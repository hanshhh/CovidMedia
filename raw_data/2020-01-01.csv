On a chilly, boisterous night in north London, Arsenals 72m record signing produced a fine attacking performance that was startling in more ways than one. Startling first of all because Pp was able to unpick the left side of Manchester Uniteds defence with such ease that the heavy-legged, heavy-footed, and indeed heavy Luke Shaw looked genuinely lost at times, a single stone Easter Island head planted in the sand, watching on in sombre silence as a game of football took place around him.   Related: Pp strikes as Arsenal rediscover their mojo to master Manchester United   And startling also because it was Nicolas Pp; and this has not been Pps story at Arsenal, at least not before now. Arsenal were aggressive in midfield and coherent in their attacking plans. Mesut zil ran the game as a genuine No 10. Toward the end he took a dropping ball just outside his own area with such a beautifully soft, cushioned touch that his left boot seemed to cradle and cosset the ball, like a man tickling a cat beneath the chin. And again Arsenals attacking plan was startling for other reasons too. Mainly, it was startling because Arsenal actually had an attacking plan; and this has not been the story of this team, at least not before now. The ballad of Nicolas Pp has made for a curious tale so far. At times he has been vague, peripheral, hard to define, and hostage to the idiot-wind of online Arsenal rage. But really, whose fault is this? To what degree can one high-priced inside-forward be expected to fix this huge, listing entity, the mixed and flowing substance that is Arsenal? Or even to step outside the general flow of Arsenal-ism, a condition that has been defined by vagueness, entropy, drift. It is these qualities that Arteta has set his face against in his early days. We are asking the players to do something different, he wrote before the game, to play at a different pace, much more aggressive than theyve been used to.    Mikel Arteta: He looks like a handsome tailors mannequin haunted by the spirit of a Victorian wraith. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters   More aggressive, more physical. This is, it should be said, a low bar. But there has been a notable cranking of the throttle. And to his credit Arteta went with the full gun here, starting Pp alongside Alexandre Lacazette and PierreEmerick Aubameyang. Arsenals manager makes for a compelling figure on the touchline. He looks like a man entirely possessed by the task. He looks like he lives every pass. He looks like a handsome tailors mannequin haunted by the spirit of a Victorian wraith. But Arteta is nothing if not furiously thorough in his preparation. Here he seemed to have grasped before anyone else that Pp should, given a clear run, have the beating of Shaw every time. And so it came to pass. There were some early splutters. Three times in the opening five minutes United had one of those cavalry charge attacks at the Arsenal back four, bearing down on that strangely vacant space where usually some footballers stand.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors picks.  After which Arsenal began to impose their own patterns. Pp opened the scoring with a slightly strange goal. Aubameyang twirled out to the right and laid the ball inside for Sead Kolasinac. His cross took a flick off Victor Lindelfs heel. Pp scuffed it back across goal, but with enough meat on the shot to defeat David de Geas dive. Steadily Pp seemed to realise that Shaw just wasnt able to follow his movements. Pp glided inside. Shaw flinched. Pp produced a regal stop and turn that left his man scrambling on the turf in a jumble of limbs. He looked in those moments like what he is, a high-end footballer with the kind of poise and snap that seems to make the day stand still just a little when he has the ball.   Related: Arsenal 2-0 Manchester United: Premier League  as it happened   It could have been more. Towards half time Pp took a poor clearance from De Gea and had time to wait, take a breath, consider the fleeting nature of youth, power, beauty, talent, then curl a shot on to the foot of the post. It could have been more also because Pp didnt quite do to Shaw what he might have done, an opponent who was reduced at times in the face of zil, Pp and Ainsley Maitland-Niles to the status of a training aid, a defensive hurdle rigged up out of three sacks of grain and a pumpkin for a head. Rinse him! one Arsenal fan kept shouting. But Pp didnt quite rinse Shaw, or didnt quite rinse him enough to kill the game completely. Pp has balance, touch, pace. He just lacked a bit of viciousness here. Perhaps it will come. He left the pitch shortly after the hour mark having attempted 26 passes and made all 26 of them, completed more dribbles than anyone else and won as many headers as any Arsenal defender. It felt, as all new eras should, like a start had been made.","822"

The Australian side will take on a sickly New Zealand side, search for their sixth straight Test victory against them, and do so under sick skies. It will be eerie. The New Years Test traditionally occupies that intangibly lazy, hazy mental space between the year end and the year anew. Everyones away and everything slows as images of a dazzling harbour and skyline provide the broadcast backdrop to some Australian feat or other as a happy, usually-dead-rubber Test gently brings the Test summer to a close.   Related: Australia and New Zealand focus on victims as bushfires threaten third Test   Instead, thick smoke is forecast to envelop the ground during its early stages, providing an inescapable, all-too-tangible haze from nearby bushfires. At the ground and across TV, radio and the internet, crickets place in the wider conversation will be subtly arm-wrestled and will likely divide itself along the political battle lines we all know. Some will feel the hitherto unseen SCG smoke is yet another signal of existential emergency. Others will say now is not the time, just enjoy the game. It will be interesting to compare the broadcasters on this score. Others may favour gallows humour. Among club cricketers, the Pepsi Challenge is the name given to ones decision to party on Friday night in anticipation of Saturday wet weather, and by extension, cancellation of play. Given Cricket Australias revised air pollution guidelines, club cricketers may now take a Friday night gamble on the Air Quality Index, burgling themselves a night out in anticipation of hazardous air cancelling a Saturday game. The AQI Challenge doesnt quite have the same ring as the Pepsi Challenge, but this issue will be around long enough that somebody will eventually name it.   Related: 'Ridiculous  I'm not a fan': four-day Tests plan meets player resistance   New names have ruled this weeks lead-in too. That Mitchell Swepson may be picked in the XI was always going to be the easy story, though pinpointing for whom was not. To this question, Shane Warne suggested that the answer was almost anywhere. Rest a quick. Rest a bat. Rest Lyon. When the latter suggestion was put to him, the now-reflexively abrasive Lyon reminded us that Warne would never have done the same with Stuart MacGill. It was a fair point, though Lyon might be careful drawing comparisons between Swepson and MacGill. If Swepson can offer what MacGill was able to, then might Warne be right? Swepson went on to laugh the whole thing off while simultaneously welcoming Warnes support, of course. Though he does so at his peril. Warnes other pet projects: Riley Meredith for the World Cup, Glenn Maxwell in all three forms, and the big one, DArcy Short as the new David Warner, have not (yet) managed to manifest. But Swepson has improved noticeably, and frankly, so far ahead are Australia from their opposition, it would probably do no risk to another Australian victory were he to play. How does New Zealand rally from here? Reports suggest that both Kane Williamson and Henry Nicholls are battling flu symptoms, which can only compound the demoralisation their batters must feel at the prospect of going toe-to-toe with Cummins, Starc, Pattinson, Lyon, et al. Tom Blundell batted brilliantly for his second innings hundred in Melbourne, but its difficult to look past the relentlessness of Australias fast bowling at this moment. It evokes memories of late last century  if McGrath doesnt get you, Gillespie will. If you see them off, enjoy Brett Lee. Now thats done, heres Shane Warne. For the New Zealand batters, its hard to know where the break arrives. Even Marnus Labuschagne now averages a tick over 30 with the ball.   Related: End of Steve Smith's leadership ban rendered irrelevant by Tim Paine   Though while theyre here, the Australian public would do well to enjoy Neil Wagners work. Working alongside bowlers of minimal velocity and negligible spin, he has been a one-person wrecking ball, bowling with great skill, intelligence and endurance. Through his bouncer barrage, not one of Australias batters has been able to dominate him. Bouncers require so much skill and exertion that bowlers typically use it as a short-term tactic, for physical reasons as much as anything else. But it appears Wagner does not know how to stop. And his intimidation doesnt cease there. Per his Perth press conference, he also appears to be prepared to pronounce Labuschagne in the way Marnus says its intended. Few things upset some Australians more. Cultural vagaries aside, while Friday looms as New Zealands last chance to strike a meaningful blow this series, more likely is an Australian procession on the back of unremitting pace and pressure. Though much like Sydneys fireworks, for many this Tests joy may be deeply subdued  its hazy spirit now replaced by actual haze.","770"

Do you like RIPPING YARNS? Do you think theres no greater pleasure than a brilliant story brilliantly told? You do? Well, have I got good news for you. Which is: BBC Ones new series Dracula is a pure and joyous BELTER. Its in three parts of 90 glorious minutes each, adapted by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss. And it is basically Sherlock but about Dracula. And peak Sherlock at that: seeking always to entertain the audience, revitalising the story while revelling in its absurdity, clever without being clever-clever, and strewn with comic and dramatic flourishes that give you the feeling that this is not just a treat but a tribute  to the author, to the season, to you as an intelligent viewer. Its a proper job, is what Im saying. And that means proper scares. No spoilers, but the one in the [redacted] when the [redacted] suddenly [redacted] had me clinging to the ceiling. I advise parental supervision at all times. My dad was annoyed at having to come over, but needs must when the devil calls and starts emanating from your screen. Everything you need is here. A dark, unmappable, labyrinthine castle. Gnarled hands resting on balcony ledges, their unseen owner lurking in shadowy recesses. Terrified locals. Bats. Babies crying. Primal fears inescapably roused.    The story unfolds within two timeframes, the Now and the Then. In the Now, where we begin, a strangely deformed man is being interviewed in a nunnery by Sister Agatha (Dolly Wells) who  and Im calling it now  is quite the best nun of all time, and not just because she has no time at all for God. Like many women my age I am trapped in a loveless marriage, maintaining appearances for the sake of a roof over my head, she says briskly. She is investigating the mans tale of escape from someone he calls Count Dracula. The mans name is Jonathan Harker and he is played by John Heffernan with the same utter conviction brought to the story by the rest of the cast via a script and direction that are all refreshingly devoid of any shred of cynicism. You may point, as apparent disproof of my assertion, to Sister Agathas response to Harkers failure to realise the significance of an SOS message written in English in the heart of eastern Europe: You are an English man, she explains. A combination of presumptions beyond compare. But you would be wrong. She is simply a truth-teller, unfettered by convention. This is quite different. Also, top nunning. I will brook no riposte. Harker was brought by a fisherman to the nunnery, having been found washed up on the banks of a nearby river muttering about forces of evil. He looks a half-formed thing  bald and white and smooth, a cross between Voldemort and Ryan Reynolds irradiated Deadpool  as well, it turns out, he might.   Related: Claes Bang on playing a sexy Dracula: 'He's insatiable and not just for blood!'   Harker is a lawyer who was sent to talk a mysterious client through some legal issues at his castle. Thats the Then. The client is an unsettling, old, old man with a  Transylvanian, is it?  accent who says exactly the things you want an old, old man with a Transylvanian accent and an unmappable castle to say. Things such as I dont drink  wine, and The people around here have no flavour. Perhaps you mean character? suggests Harker gently. Perhaps, replies the old, old man. When asked if there is anyone else living in the place, he replies No. Theres no one  living here. It is around this point that you find your bum wriggling its way more firmly into the sofa.  The client takes a shine to him, and so Harker must stay. His health fails, he gets weaker by the day  but the years fall away from Dracula until he stands revealed as Danish actor Claes Bang, embodying exactly the wolfish charm and diabolic spirit you love to see in a prince  wait, what am I saying?! The prince of darkness. Its a bloodstained love letter to a classic, beautifully and delicately scented with just the faintest hint of ham gothic yarns need; a homage to all the great Counts who have gone before, but still entirely its own thing. And again, like the best of Gatiss and Moffats Sherlocks, with the searching intelligence that promises to flesh out the foundational story. Enjoy sinking your teeth into it all.","742"

And I am missing the action  @lalithasundaram @martin_josephp @Arsenal— Kannan Venu (@kannanvenu) January 1, 2020      9.56pm GMT   United just could not create anything of use. Lingard and Pereira were frankly poor (and have been for a while). Surely Solskjaer must do all he can to sign Christian Eriksen.     9.53pm GMT   Mesut Ozil completed 90 minutes which is a rare sight. I say this without any research but its certainly a positive for Arsenal.     9.52pm GMT   The Emirates is singing Sweet Caroline while Arteta goes to each member of his team to celebrate. They players seem to like him, thats for sure.      9.51pm GMT  Full-time: Arsenal 2-0 Manchester United  A fine first-half performance from Arsenal was enough to see them through. Their attacking players excelled and created two well-worked goals, while their defence solid throughout and United just could not break it down.     9.50pm GMT   90+2 mins: Theres been plenty off huffing and puffing from United but without any real quality in the final third, which must worry Solskjaer. The latest being Mata finding Rashford in the box but he volleys into Lenos chest. Keown gives Luiz Man of the Match. It could have been a number of players in their defensive ranks. Torreira and Xhaka have also been excellent.      9.47pm GMT   90 mins: Four minutes added on.     9.46pm GMT   89 mins: Aubameyang breaks clear of Fred, who tries to take him down but fails. The striker gets to the edge of the box and tries to find the marauding Nelson but the cross is not good enough and United clear.  Daire Finnie offers: Maguire on course to be Uniteds most expensive mistake since Pogba. He may yet come good but the first 20 odd games for United he has been by far the weakest link in defence..even when Young has played.     9.44pm GMT   87 mins: If Artetas methods are going to work then he needs a fitter squad. Other (better) teams than United will break them down if they are this fatigue in the second half. They are still holding on here.      9.42pm GMT   85 mins: Arsenal are playing very deep and United just cannot find a way through at the moment.      9.40pm GMT   83 mins: Torreira has taken on some energy gel and is battling his way through the final few minutes.     9.38pm GMT   81 mins: Arsenal have some issues. Lacazette is down, Torreira looks done for. Arteta only has one sub left. In the end Guendouzi replaces Lacazette.  Mata replaces Matic for United.      9.36pm GMT   79 mins: Aubameyang cuts in from the left, dribbles towards the box, gives it to Lacazette who opens his body up but whacks his shot high and wide from 20 yards.  Saka leads a break out from Arsenal, using his fresh legs to dribble beyond on the United defence but he shoots off-balance and it trickles into De Geas hands.      9.34pm GMT   77 mins: Guendouzi is ready to come on, one assumes for Torreira.      9.32pm GMT   75 mins: Fred swings in a cross from the right, after the referee has a word with Sokratis about something or other, which Leno punches clear.  Arsenal break and Ozil plays a fine pass for Lacazette to run onto but the Frenchman is static.   Updated at 9.32pm GMT    9.30pm GMT   73 mins: United are penning Arsenal in and the hosts are struggling to hold them back. Greenwood collects the ball on the edge of the area and strikes a low drive which Leno drops on top of.      9.28pm GMT   71 mins: Martial pulls the ball back from the byline, Fred collects it and lays it off to Wan-Bissaka who takes the ball into the box and goes down under a challenge. United call for a penalty, Arsenal claim its a dive and VAR gives nothing.     9.26pm GMT   69 mins: Kolasinac has dropped to the floor with his usual ankle issue and he is replaced by Saka. I would argue the second was not a bookable offence but it was a close call. You do indeed have a point.  @Will_Unwin ""Send your complaint letter to Chris Kavanagh.""I just might ;)It's a fair point however, no?

Maybe someone has a problem in the Arsenal defence ...     9.22pm GMT   65 mins: United are putting pressure on the Arsenal defence. Martial drives into the Arsenal box only to be crowded out but he gets the ball to Pereira, who lays it off to Rashford and he curls a shot just over the bar.      9.20pm GMT   63 mins: Pepe departs and Nelson comes on. Martial pushes the Arsenal man off the side of the pitch to speed up proceedings.

Photograph: John Walton/PA    Updated at 9.26pm GMT    9.16pm GMT   59 mins: Matic turns himself inside and out on the edge and then works it through to Pereira but he snatches at the shot and it whacks into the side netting. I am not saying it is the rules, just that it could be a factor in the referees mind. Send your complaint letter to Chris Kavanagh.  @Will_Unwin ""Already on a booking, so a touch of lenience added?""Is that the rule now? I must have missed that... Exact same tackle on the same player in virtually the same position, should have been a 2nd yellow.— Joseph Shinners (@JosephShinners) January 1, 2020      9.14pm GMT   57 mins: Pereira and Greenwood are on for United. Lingard is coming off, as hes been awful, and James is also withdrawn.      9.12pm GMT   55 mins: James gets into the box and spots a gap at the front post so tries a cheeky shot but Leno gets down well and holds on.  Fred whacks one from 25 yards with his right boot but its right down Lenos throat.      9.10pm GMT   53 mins: Lingard fires a shot from 20 yards but it is blocked by Luiz in the area. United are having more of the ball in this half but struggling to do anything with it.      9.08pm GMT   51 mins: United have sent a few players out to warm up. Changes must be coming.     9.07pm GMT   49 mins: Martial dissects the defence with a pass but its got too much on it for Rashford and calmly dribbles into Lenos arms.  Fred again scythes down Lacazette and still avoids a booking. Kolasinac got carded in the opening few minutes for a little push. The referee has been inconsistent.      9.04pm GMT   47 mins: Luiz comes out of defence to whack the ball against James for his own amusement. Fred then catches Lacazette on the shin but the referee takes no further action.  No changes for United but surely it cannot be long until Solskjaer rolls the dice.      9.02pm GMT  Second half  Here we go again!      8.59pm GMT   Dael Morris points out: United look woeful. Youve been right that the problems are with Matic, whos simply outpaced, and Shaw, whos simply not good or smart enough, but you have to credit the Arsenal teams willingness to press everyone in possession. United look stunned every time theyre closed down. Also, both Lindelof and Maguire are at fault for the goals. They both need to be closing down attackers and in the case of both goals the goal scorers have far too much time to decide what to do, mainly because the defenders are clueless.  Its a weird game to watch as a United supporter, because United look like they have never really started and are trying to remember what they were told in the briefing, rather than deal with what theyre actually facing. Its all common this season to see United play like theyre learning. Certainly the best Ive seen Arsenal play for a long old while. I am taking nothing away from them.     8.57pm GMT   Already on a booking, so a touch of lenience added?  @Will_Unwin Any thoughts as to why the tackle in the closing minutes by Kolasinac on James wasn't a booking? It was the exact same tackle that earned him one in the first half. Ref chickening out of issuing a 2nd yellow?— Joseph Shinners (@JosephShinners) January 1, 2020      8.56pm GMT   Martin Lancon asks about Luiz: How does he get away with it, two off the ball fouls, both seen by VAR, one given as foul, surely yellow in hindsight after first. He used to get away with it at Chelsea as well, sneakily dirty player but never carded because never seen by ref the type of incident that I thought was one of the reasons for VAR. He knows when to do it to avoid the glare of the officials.     8.53pm GMT   David Moyes is a genius.

Theres been plenty of zip about Arsenal and they thoroughly deserve the lead with their front four looking extremely dangerous whenever the ball goes near them.      8.45pm GMT   45 mins: One minute added on.     8.44pm GMT   44 mins: The Emirates is bouncing, something which has not happened for a while.

The resulting inswinging corner from Pepe is flicked on at the front post by Lacazette and De Gea can only palm it into the danger zone where Sokratis is waiting to smash the ball in from a few yards out.

Arsenal are definitely a more attacking and inventive force under Arteta. Long may it continue.      8.39pm GMT   38 mins: De Geas latest error sees him try to whack a clearance straight into Lacazette but it just clips the striker and goes about 18 yards to Pepe, who pikcks up the ball, cuts in and curls a shot against the base of the post.

Pepe lays it into Lacazette in the area, he spins Maguire but then sends his shot closer to the corner flag than the goal.    Alexandre Lacazette slices wide. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images    Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.30pm GMT   30 mins: Maguire then seems to catch Lacazette when jumping for a header but the referee sees nothing in it. It looks like Maguire catches the striker in the back of the head with his elbow, leaving the Frenchman to rub his head. There is nothing malicious in it but it should be a foul.      8.28pm GMT   28 mins: Martial drives into the area but Sokratis gets round to clear the ball out of a throw.  A less successful intervention from a centre-back sees Maguire clean out Ozil about five seconds late to stop a counter-attack.      8.26pm GMT   26 mins: One obvious thing about United is how much they miss McTominay in the middle of the park. No one else can match his energy in there and things just look quite sluggish. To mix things up, a long ball is played over the top for Rashford to chase but Leno reads the danger and comes outside of his box to head clear. I think turning the defence and using the pace of their attackers could be a fruitful concept tonight.     8.24pm GMT   24 mins: United are popping the ball around a bit but they are struggling with the final pass.

Ian Collins writes in to discuss poor Luke: Are we saying that Jose was right about the once great hope for England left back and that hes just not that good? I agree with Mourinho on everything.     8.20pm GMT   20 mins: Arsenals front four seem to have a better understanding than Uniteds who are yet to click tonight, playing some sloppy passes as attacks keep breaking down.  24 - Amongst all players within the Top 5 European leagues since the start of last season, only Lionel Messi (45) has scored more left-footed league goals than Nicolas Pp (24 - alongside Mo Salah).

United need to get Fred on the ball a bit more as Matic just does not have the passing range to cause problems.      8.16pm GMT   16 mins: This sounds delightful ... as a fellow south Londoner, I can confirm this is not a regular occurrence but I am also quite pro-Pepe.   I'm on the bus on my way home from work. A bloke is sitting across from me watching the match on his phone and giving us all the benefit of his somewhat pro-Pepe commentary @Will_Unwin.

South London eh?— Gary Naylor (@garynaylor999) January 1, 2020      8.14pm GMT   14 mins: Luiz is done for holding Martial on the halfway line, which is frankly pointless.

Hopefully by now your hangover has subsided and you have moved back onto solids. Speaking of hangovers, Arsenal are still trying to get over the one induced by pumping 75% proof Unai Emery into their veins. New boss Mikel Arteta looks to have brought some endeavour and freedom to Arsenals attacking players but the same old issues continue in defence and it cost them two late goals and the match against Chelsea. Arteta will be hoping he can secure his first win tonight but that will not be as easy as it seemed a couple of months ago. Manchester United have lost just once in their last nine games and will be hoping to carry that fine form on at the Emirates. Paul Pogba could be brought back into the side after sitting out the relatively routine 2-0 win over Burnley. Unlike Arsenal, United have plenty of players who have found consistency and look like they could genuinely challenge for a top-four spot. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are very much on the same wavelength and Fred is running things from midfield, which is a bit of a shock considering the fact he spent a long time at the club looking woefully out of his depth and its even better news due to the injury to Scott McTominay. The United defence was never in trouble at Turf Moor, an impressive feat for a side who have struggled to keep cleansheets this season, not helped by their goalkeeper chucking one in.  Its a new year and new beginnings, which is cracking news for Arteta, while Ole Gunnar Solskjr will just want to carry on where he left off last year.  Should be a cracker under the lights.

"2020-01-01T22:06:10Z","football","Football","Pépé strikes as Arsenal rediscover their mojo to master Manchester United","Mikel Arteta has his first win as the Arsenal manager on the back of a dominant first-half performance against Manchester United and if there is a distance to cover before the clubs past glories are recovered it is at least a start. Arsenal had kicked off in 13th place, four points above the relegation zone, and everybody knew another home defeat would make it four in a row  admittedly not all on Artetas watch but equal to a club record.   Related: Spectral Arteta coaxes Nicolas Pp back from the living dead   Arteta has advised supporters not to look at the table, merely to judge the performances, but it does look a little less gloomy now, with Arsenal back in the top half. Moreover, the collective performance was good, built on spirit, hard work and sound game management, even if it came against a United team who were loose at the back and bankrupt in creative terms. Arsenal might have scored more in the first-half but the goals from Nicolas Pp and Sokratis Papastathopoulos gave them more than enough to defend. United had arrived in decent form, their confidence up and it was a chance for them to close on fourth-placed Chelsea, who had drawn at Brighton earlier in the day. The game felt well set for United, given their preference to sting on the counterattack against teams who play on the front foot but they never got going. Even in the second half, when they had the territorial advantage, they struggled to create anything of note. Arsenal sat back, denying them the chance to break and that was pretty much that. Arteta has made intensity a priority and Arsenal started positively just as they had done against Chelsea on Sunday. Once again, they took an early lead and it was a big moment for Pp, the 72m record signing, who profited from close range after Sead Kolasinacs low cross had flicked off Victor Lindelfs heel. United wanted an offside against Kolasinac, who had collected a pass from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but VAR confirmed the left-back was level. This was once the fixture of the Premier League season but a glance at the league table before kick-off told its own story. Those clashes, in which players such as Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane were prominent, were frequently underscored by spite and there were bits of niggle in this one, the tone set when David Luiz went through Anthony Martial in the first minute. He escaped a booking but Kolasinac did not when he pulled down Daniel James in the next action. The referee, Chris Kavanagh, was a busy man, ruling on a host of borderline incidents.    Mikel Arteta congratulates his Arsenal players after a much-improved performance. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters   United flickered at the outset before settling into a strangely passive groove, their only ploy being to play balls up the channels for their pacy attackers. It was too predictable. In the continued absence of the injured Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay, Ole Gunnar Solskjr played Fred and Nemanja Matic in central midfield and they were sluggish, to put it mildly; the formers performance summed up by the 90th-minute free-kick that threatened the top tier of the stand. In front of them, Jesse Lingard was anonymous as the No 10. Harry Maguire, who laboured at the back, sent a free header at Bernd Leno on 45 minutes  Uniteds only first-half chance  and, by then, Arsenal were 2-0 up, the second goal following horrible defending on a Pp corner. Marcus Rashford was statuesque as Alexandre Lacazette darted in front of the near post to flick on and, although David De Gea reacted smartly to save, the ball came off Lindelf again and Sokratis lashed home. The goal had been advertised, with Arsenal having tightened their grip from the half-hour mark. Lacazette turned Maguire brilliantly inside the area before toe-poking wide  he had to unload the effort quickly  while Lucas Torreira shot narrowly past the post after stealing away from Fred. Uniteds sloppiness was reflected by a botched clearance from De Gea, which hit Lacazette and broke for Pp. He stepped away from Matic and curled a shot against the post. Arsenal won the midfield battle, with the fit-again Granit Xhaka enjoying an encouraging 90 minutes.   Related: West Ham put four past Bournemouth to welcome back David Moyes in style   Solskjr had been determined to concentrate on the players who were at his disposal but, inevitably, Pogbas absence provided a subplot. It was revealed after the game that the midfielder needs surgery on the foot injury that has wrecked his season and the operation would rule him out for the rest of the month. It should mean that a January transfer is out of the question but, with the battle lines drawn between the club and Pogbas agent, Mino Raiola, there have to be questions about how much longer the player wants to remain at Old Trafford. Raiola has said that United are out of touch with reality and without a sporting project, a club that would even ruin Maradona, Pel and Maldini. Artetas team are not ready to maintain the physical demands he makes of them and they dropped deeper from the beginning of the second half. United took up residence in the Arsenal half, as Solskjr swapped Lingard and James for Mason Greenwood and Andreas Pereira. The latter had a sight of goal when he was played through by Matic only to hit the side-netting but that would be as good as it got for United, with their desperation being reflected when Aaron Wan-Bissaka tried to win a penalty with a dive. Like his team, he got nothing. For Arsenal, to borrow a line from Sokratis, the fun is back.","919"
"2020-01-01T22:00:15Z","politics","Politics","Poll of Labour members suggests Keir Starmer is first choice","Keir Starmer has emerged as an early frontrunner in the Labour leadership race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn after a poll of members suggested he was the first choice in all regions of the UK, age groups and social classes. The shadow Brexit secretary is yet to formally launch his campaign but is expected to do so in the first few weeks of the new year. The new leader will be elected in March after Corbyn said he would step down following the partys catastrophic general election defeat. Polling by YouGov for the Party Members Project put Starmer as winning with a 61% vote share to 39% for the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, in the last round.Jess Phillips, the chair of the womens parliamentary Labour party, who has yet to declare if she is running, was the third most popular choice among members, who were surveyed between 20 and 30 December. The results at this preliminary stage suggest that the winner is unlikely to come from the left of the party, according to Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, who jointly ran the poll with the University of Sussex. This is not shaping up to be a 2015-style Labour leadership contest. Unless potential candidates drop out before the start of voting, it may take a few rounds to decide the winner this time around. But it doesnt look at the moment as if the winner will come from the left of the party. Right now anyway, Keir Starmer looks to be heading for a fairly emphatic victory, he said. So far only the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow treasury minister, Clive Lewis, have officially said they want to run to be the next Labour leader. Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, and the Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, are expected to stand while the former Labour minister and home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, is understood to be weighing up her options as to whether she will vie for the leadership for a second time. The party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery  who lambasted the partys performance for their muddled stance on Brexit  might also run. A former National Union of Mineworkers chair who supports leaving the EU, he would be the most leftwing of all the potential candidates. The poll will be interesting reading for all those who said they were using the Christmas break to decide whether to launch official campaigns and gain the signatures of MPs needed to get on the ballot. In the survey of 1,059 Labour party members, 31% put Starmer as their first-choice candidate, 20% backed Long Bailey as their favourite, Phillips received 11% and Lewis and Cooper were the first choice for 7% of surveyed members. Thornberry was on 6% and Nandy was on 5%.  Percentage of party members putting the following candidates as first choice  With the dont knows removed from the survey and numbers put through a simulated leadership vote, Prof Bale and Prof Paul Webb of the University of Sussex found Starmer beat Long Bailey in the last round by 61% to 39%. In the simulation, Phillips was knocked out in the penultimate round with 18% of the vote. Cooper made it through to the fourth round. Nandy and Thornberry were the first to be knocked out. The leave-remain split may impact on the eventual vote as Long Bailey is ranked first by just 19% of Labour members who voted remain in 2016 but by 31% of those who voted leave. Starmer, on the other hand, is ranked first by only 17% of leavers but by 34% of remainers. The majority of party members are remainers, which may work in his favour in an actual vote. There is little difference between the popularity of the candidates between men and women, although Long Bailey is fractionally more popular among male members. It certainly doesnt look as if Labours members are necessarily persuaded that its time the party had a female leader. They seem more interested in picking the best person for the job, irrespective of gender, said Bale, who co-wrote Footsoldiers: Political Party Membership in the 21st century with Webb and Monica Poletti. Starmer is also shown in the survey to be more popular than Long Bailey in all age groups but particularly with those aged over 60. He also was more popular with middle-class members by 14 percentage points over Long Bailey. Much of the reflection among members after the election has been on whether Labour needs someone from the north of England to reconnect to voters in former heartland seats that fell to the Tories. However, the most northern of all the MPs  Lisa Nandy  does not seem any more popular among Labour members living in the north than with those in other UK regions. Labours northern members seem to be just as keen as members from other parts of the country on Starmer, who represents Holborn and St Pancras in north London. Scottish members were shown to much prefer Starmer to Long Bailey, who polled at 11% compared with Starmers 42%.  Bale said: For all the talk of Labour needing some northern grit in order to help it regain its so-called northern wall seats and working-class voters, it looks like the membership are more interested in who they think will do the best job than where or what background they come from. The survey of 1,059 Labour members, weighted by age, gender and region, was commissioned from YouGov by the Party Members Project, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and run by Prof Tim Bale (Queen Mary University of London) and Prof Paul Webb (University of Sussex).","939"

Hes a thoroughly decent guy, who has waited so long for this, and Im chuffed to bits for him. At the age of 49, when most thought his time had passed, he has reached the promised land. Wayne Mardle makes a very good point on Sky. Wright has won it the hard way.

Van Gerwen took out 40 per cent, Wright 55 per cent - and his timing was better as well.

In the context of all those previous defeats, it was a glorious performance.     9.17pm GMT   Heres Peter Wright again Ive calmed down now!

Van Gerwen 3-4 Wright (legs: 1-1)  Wright, again under pressure, starts with a 180 on his own throw. But van Gerwen is still on his case, hitting 180 on his second visit.

This is just brilliant.     8.35pm GMT   MVG starting to look annoyed now - which doesnt bode well for Wright, says Stephen Carr. The former has gears to go through whereas I dont think Wright has. Testimony to MVGs ability as Wright is playing so well.  Wright has been much better on doubles, though, and if he stays at 60 per cent win I think hell win. Whether he will is another matter. Its been a fascinating game, and a bit like watching the old MvG - astonishing scoring and some dodgy doubling.     8.32pm GMT  VAN GERWEN WINS THE SEVENTH SET! Van Gerwen 3-4 Wright (legs: 3-1)  Van Gerwen leaves 53 after nine on his own throw, and cleans it up in two darts to take the set against the throw. Thats huge.     8.30pm GMT   VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 2-4 Wright (legs: 2-1)  Thats a huge moment! Van Gerwen hits the bullseye to take out 84 and move within one leg of taking the set against the darts. This is some game, certainly the best of the tournament.     8.28pm GMT   VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 2-4 Wright (legs: 1-1) More ludicrous scoring from van Gerwen, who hits a 180 and a 177 en route to an 11-darter. Big leg, this next one.     8.27pm GMT   WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 2-4 Wright (legs: 0-1) Wright has the darts in this set, with the chance to go 5-2 ahead. Van Gerwen almost breaks, missing D7 for a 134, and Wright takes out D20 at the first opportunity. Wright is 60 per cent on doubles, van Gerwen just 33. Thats the game.  Updated at 8.27pm GMT    8.25pm GMT  WRIGHT WINS THE SIXTH SET! Van Gerwen 2-4 Wright (legs: 0-3)  Wright takes the set 3-0 on the van Gerwen throw! MvG missed three more at double  thats becoming a problem  and that allowed Wright to take out 80.     8.22pm GMT   WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 2-3 Wright (legs: 0-2) Wright is the better player at the moment. He takes out 81 again, this time in 11 darts, to go within one leg of a 4-2 lead.     8.21pm GMT   WRIGHT BREAKS! Van Gerwen 2-3 Wright (legs: 0-1) Brilliant stuff from Wright, who withstood an onslaught from van Gerwen and now leads against the throw in the sixth set. He broke van Gerwen in 12, taking out 81 on D16.      8.16pm GMT  WRIGHT WINS THE FIFTH SET! Van Gerwen 2-3 Wright (legs: 1-3)  Wright breaks the van Gerwen throw to win the set! Van Gerwen missed one at D16 - thats seven in a row hes missed at double - and Wright calmly took out 96.     8.13pm GMT   WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 2-2 Wright (legs: 1-2) Oh my days. Van Gerwen somehow misses six darts at double, allowing Wright to hold despite being behind throughout the leg.     8.11pm GMT   WRIGHT BREAKS BACK! Van Gerwen 2-2 Wright (legs: 1-1) Wright hits seven perfect darts before missing T19. The crowd boo but the break of throw is far more important than a nine, and Wright returns to take D16 for a 10-darter. This is glorious.     8.09pm GMT   VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 2-2 Wright (legs: 1-0) This is a vital set for Wright, who has the throw. If he loses this he might start to fear the worst  not least because van Gerwen is playing devastatingly well. He goes out in 12 to break again, and has now won seven of the last nine legs.      8.07pm GMT   The match averages  Van Gerwen 104.96 Wright 102.34      8.06pm GMT   Having the final on New Years Day is a bad idea, says Roger Kirkby. The main players in the event are hungover, knackered and voiceless. They dont jump up and down much either.     8.05pm GMT   Evening and happy new year to you, Rob, says Ian Copestake. Is there any instance in which VAR might be introduced to liven things down a bit? They could use it to assess the sobriety of those making their way to the bar. Decision: no pint.     8.03pm GMT  VAN GERWEN WIN THE FOURTH SET! Van Gerwen 2-2 Wright (legs: 3-2)  Oof. In another high-class leg, both players miss one dart for the set before van Gerwen takes out D8 to level the match. The van Gerwen surge is one of the greatest sights in sport, and the last two sets have been MvG porn. But Wright was good enough to stay with him in the fourth and could easily have pinched it. This is blistering stuff.    Michael van Gerwen reacts as he comes back. Photograph: Steven Paston/PA    Updated at 8.13pm GMT    8.00pm GMT   WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 2-2) A really impressive hold from Wright, who has been battered in the last few legs.     7.59pm GMT   VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 2-1) This is great stuff now. Van Gerwen hits 180 and 140 to take his match average up t0 107, and misses D18 for a 12-darter. No matter: he returns to clean up in 14.     7.57pm GMT   VAN GERWEN BREAKS BACK! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 1-1) Van Gerwen ignores that inconvenient cock-up in the previous leg and continues to pummel trebles. Eventually he takes out D18 for a 13-darter.     7.55pm GMT   WRIGHT BREAKS! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 0-1) Van Gerwen has been punished! He declined the bull from 82, and then Wright took out 140  the same finish that saved him against Noel Malicdem.  Updated at 7.55pm GMT    7.53pm GMT  VAN GERWEN WINS THE THIRD SET! Van Gerwen 1-2 Wright (legs: 3-0)  Awesome. Van Gerwen takes the third set, on the Wright throw, in a total of 37 darts. His average in that set was 122.   Updated at 7.54pm GMT    7.51pm GMT   VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-2 Wright (legs: 2-0) Hes on one now! Van Gerwen has responded ferociously to going two sets down, and holds with a majestic 11-darter.     7.50pm GMT   VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 0-2 Wright (legs: 1-0) Van Gerwen breaks in 13 darts, starting with a 180 and finishing with D12. He declined a bull opportunity from 164, with Wright on 145. The gamble paid off. Peter Wright = Jimmy White? says Gary Naylor. Maybe not...     7.48pm GMT   Wright has blown leads against van Gerwen before, most famously in the 2017 Premier League final, so we shouldnt get carried away. But its been a hugely impressive start.      7.44pm GMT  WRIGHT WINS THE SECOND SET! Van Gerwen 0-2 Wright (legs: 1-3)  Peter Wright takes the second set against the darts! He nails tops for another authoritative 13-dart leg, and at the moment he is undeniably the better player. Wright is averaging 105 to van Gerwens 99, and the first two sets could hardly have gone any better.   Updated at 7.46pm GMT    7.42pm GMT   WRIGHT BREAKS! Van Gerwen 0-1 Wright (legs: 1-2) Wright starts with a 180 on the van Gerwen throw. He is outscoring MvG and leaves 81 after nine. And he takes it out, last dart in hand, to move within a leg of a 2-0 lead!     7.41pm GMT   WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-1 Wright (legs: 1-1) A comfortable hold for Wright, with van Gerwen well back on 136. Since the first leg, Wrights doubling has been impressive.     7.39pm GMT   VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-1 Wright (legs: 1-0) This is warming up nicely. Van Gerwen misses four at double, Wright cant take out tops and van Gerwen returns to take out D6.      7.34pm GMT   The averages so far  Van Gerwen 99.89 Wright 101.92      7.33pm GMT  WRIGHT WINS THE FIRST SET! Van Gerwen 0-1 Wright (legs: 2-3)  Wright takes the first set on tops  but only just. Van Gerwen wired the bull for 170, which would have been a savage blow, and Wright returned to take the leg in 14 darts. He really couldnt afford to lose that set.  Updated at 7.37pm GMT    7.31pm GMT   VAN GERWEN HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-0 Wright (legs: 2-2) Van Gerwen nails the bull to take out 86  and that means we have the first crucial fifth leg of the night. This is where van Gerwen can be deadly.     7.29pm GMT   WRIGHT HOLDS! Van Gerwen 0-0 Wright (legs: 1-2) Wright has started strongly, with more trebles and fewer loose darts than van Gerwen. After MvG misses D5 for a break, Wright takes out tops.     7.26pm GMT   WRIGHT BREAKS BACK! Van Gerwen 0-0 Wright (legs: 1-1) An immediate break back for Wright, who takes out tops for a 13-darter.  Updated at 7.27pm GMT    7.24pm GMT   VAN GERWEN BREAKS! Van Gerwen 0-0 Wright (legs: 1-0) Wright goes off with 60, MvG with just 34. That allows Wright to take control of the leg with 140 and then the first 180 of the final  but then he misses three at D20 and D10, and van Gerwen burgles the leg by taking out 88 in two darts.     7.21pm GMT   Michael van Gerwen hurries towards the stage to the sound of Seven Nation Army - and a few boos from the crowd, for some reason. Eejits. That could be a factor tonight, as it was when he lost that epic semi-final against Rob Cross two years ago.    Michael Van Gerwen is welcomed on to the stage. Photograph: Ian Stephen/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock    Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.19pm GMT   Its time for the walk-ons. Peter Wright is first, dancing across the stage to Dont Stop the Party by Pitbull. He looks slightly nervous, no more than that.     7.14pm GMT   The tournament stats are almost identical: both are 44 per cent on the doubles, with MvG averaging 98.14 and Wright 98.29. There is a compelling argument that it has been a bit too easy for van Gerwen, and that Wright will push him to produce his A-game.     7.12pm GMT   Van Gerwen is chasing a fourth world title, having won three of the last six. His big target is six - one more than Raymond van Barnevelds Dutch record.     7.01pm GMT   Peter Wright has won the bullseye and will throw first.      6.44pm GMT   Ill be rooting for Snakebite, says J.R. in Illinois. Im not a huge fan of his but Id like him to get this one. Outside of Fallon Sherrocks run I think the best moment of the tournament was when Snakebite was under massive pressure against Malicdem and he won a leg by finishing 302 with six perfect darts. Kaboom! Yeah, youd have to have a pretty hard heart  or be very, very Dutch  to begrudge Peter Wright. It makes no sense that he has only won a single UK Open.     6.29pm GMT   Pre-match reading   Related: Peter Wright 'ready' to shock Michael van Gerwen and win first PDC world title       5.51pm GMT  Preamble  Hello. Everyones looking for an angle these days, a slightly different take on things that makes them seem more interesting than the average keyboard expert. But sometimes you cant ignore the obvious. Take tonights world darts championship final at Alexandra Palace between Michael van Gerwen and Peter Wright. You just cant get past the fact that its a serial winner against a serial runner-up; that, when these two meet in a final, it invariably ends with Wright saying Ill get him next time during a rueful post-match interview. Wright is a magnificent player, one of the best never to win a world title, but his record in major finals is desperate. He has lost 12 out of 13, nine of them to van Gerwen, and it is cruelly symbolic that the only time he did win a major  the 2017 UK Open  was when van Gerwen was absent through injury. The most painful defeat was in the Premier League final of 2017, when Wright blew a 7-2 lead and missed six match darts before losing 11-10. The biggest was the world championship final five years ago, when van Gerwen won 7-4. Wright turns 50 in March, a birthday that all darts players dread, and may never have a better chance of laying the ghost. He has stopped playing silly buggers with his darts, instead sticking to the same pair, and has been the best player at a slightly underwhelming world championships. After surviving a huge scare in the first round against Noel Malicdem, he played with impressive authority to beat Seigo Asada, Jeffrey de Zwaan, Luke Humphries and Gerwyn Price. Van Gerwen, by contrast, has been a fair way from his coruscating best. His victories over Jelle Klaasen, Ricky Evans, Stephen Bunting, Darius Labanauskas and Nathan Aspinall were laboured, as if it was all a bit too easy. Van Gerwen is still the best player in the world by a distance, but hes nowhere near as unbeatable during his imperial phase in 2015-16. Wright will probably outscore van Gerwen, but that alone will not be enough. Van Gerwen has become a master of doing, to use his favourite phrase, the right things at the right moments. The timing of his breaks and big checkouts, even when he is not playing well, is often devastating. I think Wright might do it tonight, but he has got to start well. If not, the tungsten flashbacks could ruin him. The first dart will be thrown around 7.15pm local time.   Updated at 6.49pm GMT ","3190"
"2020-01-01T20:22:09Z","uk-news","UK news","Anti-Islamic slogans spray-painted near mosque in Brixton","Anti-Islamic slogans have been painted on a building close to a mosque and cultural centre in south London, the Metropolitan police have said. Officers were called to a building near the North Brixton Islamic Cultural Centre on Brixton Road at 11am on Wednesday following reports of spray-painted slogans on a building near the centre. A statement from the Met said: Officers were called at around 1100hrs on 1 January to reports of anti-Islamic slogans spray-painted on a building near to the North Brixton Islamic Centre in Brixton Road. Inquiries are ongoing at this time as part of a full investigation. We are working alongside Lambeth council to ensure the offensive remarks are removed as soon as possible. The Met added: Shockingly, hate crime affects people from all walks of life and impacts on communities across London. All members of our communities have the right to go about their daily life without fear of verbal, physical or written abuse. The Met does not tolerate any form of discrimination, and we are committed to tackling offences like this as thoroughly as possible. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, tweeted: Disgusted to hear that Islamophobic slogans have been spray painted near the North Brixton Islamic Centre. @metpoliceuk are working with Lambeth Council to have them removed, but let me be clear: all prejudice is cowardly and criminals will face the full force of the law. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary and frontrunner for Labours vacant position of deputy leader, echoed Khans words, saying: Islamophobic hate is not acceptable and should not be tolerated, it is disgusting, hate has no place in our society and we should always challenge it whenever it occurs. Councillor Mohammed Seedat, Lambeths cabinet member for community safety, said: Many of our residents fear they are living in a hostile environment. The intimidating racist graffiti on synagogues and mosques wont divide Londoners, but will confirm the worst fears of many of our residents. The council and police will continue to reassure communities. But we also need politicians, particularly the government, to act responsibly in rhetoric and action to quell the rise of extremism and division in our society  whether it is Islamist or rightwing. Florence Eshalomi, the local Labour MP for Vauxhall, tweeted: Disturbing to hear of a racist incident at the North Brixton Islamic cultural centre  it was reported that anti-Islamic slogans had been spray-painted on [the] building opposite the cultural centre. Anyone with any information pls contact the police via 101 quoting CAD 4725/01JAN. The incident comes three days after antisemitic graffiti was sprayed across a synagogue and shops in north London during the Jewish festival of Hanukah. The Star of David, a Jewish holy symbol, and the numbers 911 were spray-painted in red and purple on premises in the Hampstead and Belsize Park area, including South Hampstead synagogue. The numbers may have been intended to refer to an antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews were responsible for the terror attack on 11 September 2001; others fear it is a reference to Kristallnacht, the violent pogrom against Jews on 9 November 1938 in Nazi Germany.

Whats the other 7%? asked Doctor Whos sidekick Yaz after she surreptitiously scanned his DNA with a handheld device that left my smartphone feeling pretty inadequate. It is a good question, and the answer is not mince pies. Lord Leonard of Dudley is leaner and meaner than ever in this first episode of the new Doctor Who series, in which he plays Daniel Barton, a person of colour who has overcome all kinds of obstacles to become CEO of a global techno-oligarchy called VOR. What obstacles? As one of the few non-white people in his Bromsgrove school, he explained, Barton spent a lot of time in his bedroom developing the coding skills that would ultimately make him the most powerful human in our galaxy, certainly now Caroline Flack has stood down from Love Island. But what does VOR stand for? None of your nonsense, young lady, thats what. In truth, the answer is beyond my pay grade  but as far as I can tell its a mashup of Google, Amazon and Facebook. Barton, then, is a combination of Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, none of whom are 100% human, either. But there was a problem. Bartons DNA was colluding with super-aliens who, despite being super-aliens, were powerless when confronted by the BBCs special effects budget, which has evidently been slashed to pre-empt Boris Johnson from decriminalising licence-fee rebels. Essentially, theyre lo-fi, throbbing white silhouettes who replicate at will, and yet have booming voices that betray Rada training. Say what you like about Daleks and Cybermen, at least they had readily merchandisable costumes. That said, these aliens were scary dead ringers for cut-outs of David Bowie circa Ashes to Ashes, right down to the pierrot hats. Ive had nightmares since. Their aim? The usual. To subject the universe to their infernal will. For those who watched the recent War of the Worlds, this was HG Wells on an intergalactic scale. Clearly the Australian security grunts who fatuously shot at this superior race hadnt got the memo. The super-aliens didnt actually say: Your puny human weapons are useless against us! But it was implicit. Thats why the Doctor got the call from MI6 which, worryingly for British chances of defeating aliens or Putins goons, was headed by Stephen Fry. He delivered my favourite line in the show (Doctor, the security of the entire planet is at stake!) before being shot dead with an alien laser beam to the head, poor chap. But if Fry was fried, who would save Blighty, the planet, nay the universe? Step forward the 13th Time Lord. Jodie Whittaker is all woman with a side order of sass, eyebrows that just wont quit and trousers belonging to a taller person. Two things make her immensely likable: 1) She doesnt wear shades, and 2) She doesnt rock out with a mid-life-crisis guitar like the previous incumbent. Back to the plot. Spies were being bumped off around the world. The Doctor examined one corpse on the slab. Her DNA has been rewritten! Shes a shell with a human appearance! Humanity is being menaced by ectoplasmic David Bowies, possibly with the help of Lenny Henry. This may sound far-fetched, but one of the pleasures of showrunner Chris Chibnalls script was it made sense. Which is more than I can say for his predecessor Steven Moffats inscrutable storylines. I could have done with less product placement and fewer nods to Men in Black and James Bond, but there was a lot to enjoy. There has never been a better car chase through the Western Cape vineyards: Lenny Henry shooting from his Bentley at Jodie Whittaker on a pursuing motorbike; one national treasure trying to rub out another. I was not entirely convinced that the Doctor and her sidekicks could climb aboard a taxiing plane piloted by the fleeing Barton, but as it was essential to the denouement, Ill let it pass. In flight, the Doctors ostensible ally, O, disclosed some unbearable truths. He was not a sweet-tempered rogue MI6 agent, but her nemesis, the Master. The real O had been shrunken to the size of James Bolam in Grandpa in My Pocket. The Master, the brute, opened a matchbox to show the little fellow inside. The ectoplasmic Bowies were working for the Master, and Lenny Henry, the planes ostensible pilot, had left the cockpit empty. As the plane careered at 30,000ft and the Master cackled like Dominic Cummings on helium, it was hard not to see this as an allegory for Boriss Britain. We, too, are being fast-tracked to oblivion by scarcely human megalomaniacs. Make it stop, Jodie Whittaker! Just make it stop! Dont worry, she will in part two. Probably.  This article was amended on 6 January 2020. An earlier version incorrectly said the car chase scene took place in the Napa Valley vineyards.","812"

And were off again! Doctor Who can and should lend itself to every possible type of drama, from horror to space travel to romantic comedy and everything in between. So theres absolutely no reason why it shouldnt do the same with the spy genre. In fact, its a fine choice for a New Year spectacular. But  its a genre Ive never really got along with. Im not a James Bond fan, Im a Doctor Who fan and I know Im not the only person who feels this way. That said, showrunner Chris Chibnall has tremendous crowdpleasing fun here with the genres tropes, and Spyfall is far more spectacular and more assured than anything from the new teams first run-out.

To recap: intelligence people from around the world are being assassinated for inexplicable reasons. So the fabled champion of the unknown, known to security services as The Doctor, is kidnapped along with her friends by the Men in Black via an exhilarating car chase. A charming cameo ensues in which Stephen Fry portrays Stephen Fry portraying C, the head of MI6, who recruits them to investigate the spate of killings, equips them with a Bond geeks dream cache of gadgets, and is promptly assassinated himself. The Doctor and fam go international tag team. Yaz and Ryan are drawn into the murky inner workings of VOR, the worlds largest search engine, and plenty more malevolent activities besides.
Chibnall is hardly subtle in his portrayal of big tech  Look! This is what you should really be scared of! he tubthumps. But there is no denying that dream casting Lenny Henry is marvellous, emanating just the right balance of evil and charming as the companys founder, Daniel Barton, who turns out to be just 93% human and in league with an alien race of evil nuns made from white light, hellbent on rewriting human DNA. The usual Zuckerberk stuff.

The Doctor and Graham take refuge with O, former MI6 expert, now in self-imposed tea-drinking exile in Australia and a man who could help crack the alien conspiracy. O is a lovely, self-conscious chap who idolises the Doctor. Until ...
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh.
And the twist! O is no Romford misfit but the Doctors evil frenemy the Master, reborn as a hot camp psychopath. My heart will always belong to Michelle Gomez as the Master, but Sacha Dhawans Hot Camp Master looks like he will be terrific fun. It remains to be seen whether Chibnall can or will address how he got back from the end of Missys journey. But his introduction did feel fairly rushed. Remember how brilliantly put together the reveal of Professor Yana was, as Derek Jacobi regenerated into John Simm? Or the intricate dance to reveal Missys true identity? Here, they barely had time to jump on to the speeding aircraft before the Doctor called him out for lying that he couldnt run and the mwahahahas commenced. Still, theres clearly more to come, as long as they can all get off that exploding aircraft (spoiler, they probably will).

Will there soon be hanky panky in the time vortex?

The catchup with the fam was fun and a handy refresher as they explained their recent absences to their nearest and dearest. But it did rather dampen the central conceit that they have a time machine so the companions can return to the point they left as if they never went away. Graham seems to be getting through processing his grief for Grace, while Yaz and Ryan are growing closer. Right now it seems like a sibling dynamic, but romance isnt off the cards  especially after Yazs refusal to give her amorous sister Ryans number. Remember what happened last time there was hanky panky in the time vortex?
Fear factor
Last years paucity of scary new monsters looks set to be addressed. But at the moment theyre basically just nuns made of white light, so the jury is still out.
Mysteries and questions
As effervescent as Jodie Whittaker always is, the Doctor almost felt like a bit player in her own adventure here. But there are clearly bigger, darker things coming for Thirteen. Somethings coming for me, she warns ominously in the series trailer. And its clearly something to do with Hot Camp Masters warning: Everything you think you know is wrong Yikes.



Watch the trailer for the latest series


Deeper into the vortex
 Its nice to see the cold opens return. They felt missing last series and really give episodes an extra bit of welly.
 My names Doctor. The Doctor.
 If there were any awkwardness about Lenny Henrys recent comments about diversity in the show, you certainly couldnt tell at the series premiere. He spent most of the Q&A gushing about getting to appear.
 How are we feeling about the demise of Christmas episodes in favour of New Year specials?
Next time!
Will Team Tardis make it off the plane? (Yes.)

Related: Gabriel Jesus scored both goals for Manchester City as they started the new year with a 2-1 victory over Everton at the Etihad Stadium       7.33pm GMT   Elsewhere in the Premier League: West Ham enjoyed a new manager bounce under David Moyes, running out 4-0 winners over Bournemouth, who look to be in serious trouble. A late equaliser from the lesser-spotted Connor Wickham enabled Crystal Palace to snatch a point after they came from behind to draw with Norwich.  Earlier this afternoon, Watford continued their resurgence under Nigel Pearson with a win over Wolves, while Jose Mourinhos mask of humility was conspicuous by its absence as Tottenham lost against Southampton. Newcastle ran out 3-0 losers against Leicester at home, while Villa won on their travels to the Burnley. In the days early kick-off, Brighton and Chelsea shared the points in an entertaining match at the Amex Stadium.   Updated at 7.38pm GMT    7.28pm GMT   And Everton? While they lost a game during which Carlo Ancelotti could repeatedly be seen urging his players to get the ball forward more quickly, Everton can take heart from this performance. They defended well for long periods, restricting City to a limited number of scoring opportunities. Ultimately, however, the class of the Premier League champions prevailed.   Updated at 7.29pm GMT    7.26pm GMT   A brace for Gabriel Jesus: The Brazilian striker scored twice and struck the post to win all three points for his team.

Manchester Citys players react furiously and the Everton striker is perhaps lucky to escape with just a yellow card.      7.13pm GMT   84 min: Dominic Calvert-Lewin picks up a long ball over the top in a good position on the right byline.

They missed out on a penalty because Sidibe got his foot to the ball as he stopped Foden with a last-ditch lunge. Moments later, Mahrez went close, before Gabriel Jesus rifled a shot off the upright.      7.06pm GMT   77 min: There are loud appeals for a penalty as Phil Foden goes to ground in the Everton box.

Joao Cancelo miscontrolled a daft pass from Claudio Bravo, allowing Theo Walcott to shoot from the edge of the box.

They did have the ball in the Everton net, but VAR intervened and ruled that Riyad Mahrez had been offside in the build-up to Phil Fodens tap-in.      6.17pm GMT   45+2 min: Everton win a corner late in the first half. Gylfi Sigurdsson sends the ball into the mixer, where Yerry Mina leaps highest. Under pressure from Eric Garcia, he put his header goes over the bar.      6.16pm GMT   45+1: It seems Mahrez controlled the ball with his hand, so any goal he scored would not have counted anyway.      6.15pm GMT   44 min: Benjamin Mendy curls a cross into the Everton penalty area and it appears to drop kindly drops for Mahrez at the far post. Mason Holgate scrambles back and does enough to prevent the City winger firing off a shot.      6.13pm GMT   42 min: Riyad Mahrez drags a low diagonal effort wide of the far post after being teed up by Gabriel Jesus. It was on his weaker right foot, but he should have done better.      6.11pm GMT   41 min: Manchester City continue to dominate possession, while Carlo Ancelotti continues to criticise his players for not trying to get it forward with enough urgency when they are allowed a touch of it.      6.10pm GMT   38 min: Foden and Mendy combine down the left again and tee up Gabriel Jesus in the box.

On the touchline the Italian admonishes his players for passing the ball backwards rather than forward.      5.56pm GMT   25 min: Steve McManaman is on co-comms for BT Sport and hes criticised Everton for repeatedly trying to play the ball out from the back when theyre not good enough to do so. He suggests they should go long and give themselves a chance of winning 50-50 balls. He may well have a point - they do have a height advantage over their opponents in almost every area of the pitch.      5.54pm GMT   24 min: Another poor clearance from Pickford results in Gabriel Jesus being presented with a shooting chance from distance. He skies the ball over the bar.      5.53pm GMT   22 min: Jordan Pickford shanks a clearance into the stand and Joao Cancelo takes the ensuing throw-in. The ball goes out for another throw-in, which is taken by Evertons Luca Digne. Those two VAR interventions, the second of which was completely farcical, seem to have had a detrimental effect on the rhythm of this game.      5.51pm GMT   19 min: To be clear, if Mahrez was fouled by Digne, it was after Marriner had blown his whistle for offside against the City midfielder. After a lengthy consultation, during which the fans in the stadium had no idea what was going on, VAR decides that City arent getting a penalty. Which seems fair.      5.49pm GMT   17 min: Running towards the Everton goal, Riyad Mahrez tries to control a Fernandinho pass from deep on his chest, but is penalised for offside. Replays suggest he wasnt offside but now referee Andre Marriner seems to have been told Mahrez might have been fouled by Lucas Digne.      5.46pm GMT   15 min: On the touchline, Pep Guardiola is giving the fourth official an awful rollicking, but he cant really complain. As Manchester City swept forward, the ball was played to Mahrez in an offside position on the right wing. He played it towards Cancelo, whose excellent ball across the face of the Everton goal was stabbed home by Foden. He thought hed scored his second Premier League goal, but the wait goes on.      5.44pm GMT  VAR! Foden's goal is cancelled out!

"2020-01-01T19:40:36Z","football","Football","Gabriel Jesus strikes twice to steer Manchester City past Everton","Manchester City end the festive period with nine points from their four games after two Gabriel Jesus strikes handed Carlo Ancelotti a first defeat in charge of Everton via a characteristically relentless display. Pep Guardiola said: We played top, I am so delighted about the performance. Teams who have been champions and are far away from the leaders can give up and finish seventh or eighth. Maybe we will but not because we dont try. Citys sole reverse of the Christmas programme came last Friday at Wolves in a result that, surely, killed any hopes of catching Liverpool. Instead, their FA Cup defence begins on Saturday, with the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Manchester United on Tuesday, then in February the restart of the Champions League; all competitions on which City can now focus intently.   Related: Arsenal v Manchester United: Premier League  live!   The notable name in the home lineup was Claudio Bravo, the hardly reliable goalkeeper playing a second successive time because of Ederson being ill following a one-match suspension. The last time Bravo faced Everton  in January 2017  he allowed four goals from four shots and he added to the count here by being culpable for Richarlisons consolation. Ancelotti initially made the same number of changes as his opposite number before Bernard suffered a cut leg in the warm-up, so Tom Davies was drafted in for the Brazilian. The opening period proved low grade. An error from Ilkay Gndogan had Guardiola muttering and Davies pouncing as Everton transformed defence into an attack that ended with Gylfi Sigurdsson flipping the ball to Samus Coleman: his effort was tipped behind for a corner by Bravo. When Gndogan later tried his own chip into Riyad Mahrez, Jordan Pickford was less sure: he dropped the ball and Everton were relieved to clear. Joo Cancelo has struggled for form since joining City yet he appeared to have created an opener for Phil Foden only for VAR to rule Mahrez offside. Ancelotti had a consoling word for Guardiola who smiled and later agreed with the decision. I think it was offside, said the Catalan. VARs next involvement was confused as it checked for a possible penalty despite Mahrez seeming to be flagged for offside or handball or both. The spot-kick was not given but the contest had been disrupted and, inevitably, the invective-filled antiVAR chants had a second airing. At this juncture both benches were unhappy regarding their respective players output. For Guardiola it was Kevin De Bruyne and Foden momentarily losing their deft touch; for Ancelotti it was his mens sluggish pace and an insistence on passing back to Pickford, instead of looking forward and for the positive. Better from City was a Mahrez swivel and shot, then a Gndogan effort which also warmed Pickfords fingers. Really, though, the entertainment level was down, in a sign perhaps of the Christmas and New Year slog. Another was found in the number of offsides committed by tired players  Mahrez a particular perpetrator. Still, City had dominated the ball and when they do they often prosper. Foden had a snap-shot, gathered by Pickford, and as the break neared Mahrez had two clearer chances but steered the first wide and seemed surprised to receive the second.   Related: Gabriel Jesus strikes twice to steer Manchester City past Everton   The average fare continued after the interval. Benjamin Mendy sold De Bruyne short so he had to stick a boot out and watch the ball sail into no-mans land, much to Guardiolas chagrin. Next Bravo punted possession straight out when Cancelo was the target. Then, though, came a moment to remember. Gndogan slipped a pinpoint pass into Jesus, who in an instant had beaten Pickford with a finish that was the Brazilians 13th goal this season. From the restart Everton claimed a corner  to Guardiolas annoyance  but despite a second one following when Dominic Calvert-Lewins header deflected out there was no equaliser. The contest had opened up. Suddenly Eric Garca was curving a ball along the left to Mahrez as City upped pace and so opportunity. Soon they had a second goal, with this one straight from the Guardiola playbook. De Bruyne passed to Foden, who found Mahrez, who in turn played in Jesus and he calmly finished low past Pickford. City were coasting but then Bravo added to the catalogue of howlers by passing direct to Richarlison. From here there was an inevitability about how the No 7 would bundle home Theo Walcotts deflected attempt.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  Guardiola defended the Chilean. It happens when you play that way but thanks to him [continuing to pass out] you can make a buildup better. At the close Calvert-Lewin upended Fernandinho. The managers disagreed as to whether the booking the foul received was sufficient punishment but it did not affect the outcome.","780"
"2020-01-01T19:40:13Z","football","Football","West Ham put four past Bournemouth to welcome back David Moyes in style","As second comings go, David Moyes could not have scripted his any better. Two goals from the captain Mark Noble and one each from Sbastien Haller and Felipe Anderson ended West Hams run of four successive defeats at home and took them out of the relegation zone at the expense of a disjointed Bournemouth side.   Related: Pp strikes as Arsenal rediscover their mojo to master Manchester United   Out of work since he was jettisoned by West Hams owners in favour of Manuel Pellegrini in May 2018, how Moyes must have relished the ols which rang around the stadium in the closing stages as his side cantered to victory. Only a few days into his second spell as manager he has already shown what a difference a new face can make  something that even Bournemouths owners may even have to consider at some point given the lack of fight in Eddie Howes side here. I dont think I could have had a better start but the players have to take all the credit, Moyes said. Their attitude and commitment got the supporters behind us and that was key for us today. The former Manchester United and Everton manager had spoken of the need to restore confidence among his players after the disastrous run that cost Manuel Pellegrini his job, yet after Aston Villas victory at Burnley, West Ham found themselves in the relegation zone before kick-off  almost exactly the same position as when Moyes took over from Slaven Bilic in November 2017. Last time it took Moyes until his fourth match to record his first victory but with less than half of this campaign remaining, he knew there was no time to waste. Bournemouth looked like perfect opponents to kickstart the home sides campaign given Howes visitors had lost seven of their previous nine matches before this. Howe also made four changes to the side which lost at Brighton on Saturday with Callum Wilson leading the line despite enduring a run of 12 matches without a league goal. Moyes, who admitted this week that he had not been able to stop smiling since his reappointment, emerged just before kick-off to a decent reception from the home supporters and spent almost the entire first half prowling the technical area, clearly enjoying being back in his natural habitat. After a slow start, the 56-year-olds enthusiasm was rewarded in the 17th minute when Robert Snodgrasss cut back found Noble in acres of space and the captains shot from distance took a massive deflection off Lewis Cook to totally wrongfoot Aaron Ramsdale in the Bournemouth goal. Taking the lead  albeit through a huge slice of good fortune  seemed to immediately lighten the mood among the home supporters and it was not long until they were celebrating again. Haller, without a goal at the London Stadium since the defeat to Crystal Palace in October, has looked an increasingly dejected figure in recent weeks but the way he volleyed home a cross from Ryan Fredericks illustrated just why West Ham were prepared to pay 45m to sign him last summer.   Related: Wickham evens it up for Crystal Palace as Norwich lose early lead again   Nobles second soon after from the penalty spot when Harry Wilson was somewhat harshly adjudged to have brought down the veteran midfielder almost lifted the roof off this vast arena. Having failed to score more than one first-half goal so far this season, suddenly West Ham had three. Bournemouths woes can be traced back to Wilsons last league goal in the 3-1 victory over Southampton at the end of September. Howes side briefly found themselves in third place back then but, like Haller at West Ham, the lack of goals for their main striker has coincided with their plunge down the table. They have not looked so vulnerable since the 2017-18 season, when they were in the bottom three at Christmas before a seven-game unbeaten run catapulted them up the table. On this evidence that kind of form looks beyond them but Howe will at least be encouraged by a better performance after the break after they switched to a back three. Asked if his players are suffering from a lack of confidence, he said: I dont think it takes a rocket scientist to see its damaged. Its the first time weve been in the relegation zone for a long time but I almost think that is a good thing for us because its going to refocus energies. We need to change something. Felipe Anderson rounded off a fine individual performance with the fourth goal following a wonderful cross field pass from Declan Rice with his left foot. Further evidence that this was West Hams day came when Aaron Cresswell was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle on Ryan Fraser, only for VAR to overturn referee Graham Scotts original decision. Moyes will just hope that his good fortune can last a little longer this time.","799"

Connor Wickham was adjudged offside by the assistant referee when he put away Wilfried Zahas cross in the 86th minute but, just as with Teemu Pukkis goal against Spurs three days earlier, VAR analysed the footage and overturned the call, this time finding Wickham to have been behind Christoph Zimmermanns right foot. Norwich had held the lead since Todd Cantwell opened the scoring in the fourth minute.   Related: Arsenal v Manchester United: Premier League  live!   When you get an equaliser so late in the game and after such a strange situation again, it feels like a loss today, without any doubt, the Norwich manager, Daniel Farke, said after the match. What I have learned during this season is that each and every VAR decision went against us; I knew they would find one moment when they could paint a little nice line. When I compare our goal against Tottenham, Pukki is one yard further away from the opponent, but they found one moment when the outside of his shoulder was closer to the goal than a part of the opponents body. Today it feels like the player is one yard closer to the goal than Christoph Zimmermann, but they found a moment when they could put a little line when his toenail was closer than a part of the opponent. If you can guarantee you draw the line at the precise moment the ball leaves the foot, we have to accept it. But Im not sure you can absolutely [do] this. Farke said he did not want to talk about VAR any more, but did so at length for the second time in a week. Roy Hodgson was able to take a more phlegmatic approach. These days every goal is checked, the Palace manager said. Last week we were convinced we scored a good goal against Southampton, then found out that the goal was chalked off by the smallest of margins. Today it was the opposite. Today the fine margin has worked in our favour.   Related: West Ham put four past Bournemouth to welcome back David Moyes in style   Norwich now have won just once in their past 16 league matches and are seven points adrift of Aston Villa in 17th. It looks very much as if an immediate return to the Championship is in prospect, but the Canaries played well against an admittedly heavily depleted Palace side. They defended stoutly against a barrage of set pieces and had at least four good opportunities to double their lead. But as the game ticked down to its nervous final moments, they had only Cantwells goal to which they could cling. It came from a nice move, which saw Norwich pushing Palaces low block to the edge of their own box. Playmaker Mario Vrancic unlocked the space, stabbing a sharp pass beyond Luka Milivojevic and into the feet of Emi Buendia. The Argentinian spun past Mamadou Sakho and managed to get off a shot that was deflected, but only into Cantwells path, and his finish was clean. Palaces team sheet listed four academy players as substitutes, a reminder of the depth of their injury problems. Hodgson was missing seven firstteam players and Sakho was withdrawn at half-time with a hamstring injury. But the XI on the pitch were customarily resolute and the old fox on the sidelines played his hand well, with two late substitutes both playing their part in the equaliser. Wickham was introduced for Max Meyer and the 18-year-old forward Brandon Pierrick came on for the full-back Martin Kelly. Pierrick began the move, switching the play to Zaha out wide. Zaha, who had been the subject of ironic jeers from the home crowd after two mishit shots, beat Max Aarons and crossed to Wickham, who side-footed home. The goal was disallowed, but VAR is obliged to check and while Tim Krul set the ball up for a goalkick the big screen soon said otherwise. Decision overturned.","671"

The Championships top two sides maintained their nine-point lead over the chasing pack with this thrilling draw and if the Yorkshire club can prove as resilient between now and May as they did in recovering after half-time here, then their return to the Premier League is all but assured. Semi Ajayi gave West Bromwich Albion the lead inside 80 seconds, as Slaven Bilics side looked the more penetrative and organised in the first half, before the Nigeria defender deflected in Patrick Bamfords header early in a second half that Leeds edged.   Related: Football League: Adam helps Reading stun Fulham, QPR hit Cardiff for six   Marcelo Bielsas side stay top, on goal difference from West Brom, level on 52 points, yet they will know that having gained 48 points in the first half of last season only to fall away with a meagre 35 in the second half of the campaign before losing in the playoffs against Derby, much hard work lies ahead. But it is a worrying pattern: in the previous season they had 39 points at halfway and only added 21; in 201617 it was 45 and 30. The reintroduction of Bamford for Eddie Nketiah at half-time reignited Leeds, who were good value for their point. I thought we should have won the match, said Bielsa, the head coach. We managed the game well. There were chances in both boxes but maybe our chances were a little bit more possible. Nketiah, having started only these past two league games while on loan, now returns to Arsenal. Bielsa will consider replenishing his squad, as the little-used Jack Clarke also prepares to return to Tottenham, but potential signings may be discouraged by that pairs opportunities. West Brom have lost only twice all season but, with just one win in six games, they also welcomed this draw after the letdown against Middlesbrough on Sunday. Both teams should use it [this result] to know mentally, We are good, we coped with the best  from their side and from our side, Bilic, the head coach, said. This performance was more than enough to get our belief and momentum back. I told the players yesterday, unusually: I dont care about the result, its about the performance. We started like that [banged his hand on table] and we finished like that [another bang on table]. West Brom indeed seemed more up for it from kick-off and when Matt Phillips forced Ezgjan Alioski into conceding a corner Kiko Casilla could only punch Matheus Pereiras delivery up towards Ajayi. When his header was nodded back in from beyond the sixyard box by Kyle Bartley, Ajayi clipped the ball on the half-volley goalwards. A buzz on the officials wristwatches indicated the ball had crossed the line before being cleared.    Teammates rush to congratulate Semi Ajayi on giving West Brom a second-minute lead against Leeds. Photograph: Malcolm Bryce/ProSports/REX/Shutterstock   Fresh from their breathtaking 5-4 victory at nearby St Andrews on Sunday, Leeds proceeded to dominate possession. There were several dangerous crosses but no clearcut chances in the first period as West Brom, despite losing Kieran Gibbs to a recurring hamstring injury, worked hard and maintained a disciplined shape. Conor Townsend came on at left-back.   Related: Arsenal v Manchester United: Premier League  live!   Casilla pulled off the save of the half, when diving to tip aside the exciting Pereiras free-kick, but Leeds had a strong claim for a penalty rejected when Luke Aylings cross-shot struck Jake Livermores self-conscious arm. Wheres VAR when you need it? Reprieved, West Brom should have gone in 2-0 up at the break when Phillips broke clear on to RobsonKanus astute through pass only to shoot at Casilla. If West Brom had started the first half on fire, then Leeds lit the touchpaper for a cracking second period. Bielsa was in no mood to stand on ceremony and replaced Alioski and Nketiah with Barry Douglas and Bamford for the restart. Within six minutes, his decision was vindicated. Jack Harrison got down the left wing and delivered a wicked cross to the near post where Bamford stole a march on his marker to flick on a header that went in off Ajayi. There was a good late save from Sam Johnstone to deny Bamford before Casilla brilliantly tipped over Kyle Edwardss powerful shot as the game entered stoppage time. It was a thrilling game, full of high tempo and losses of possession, but few would argue these are the best two sides in the division.","724"

In a video message from the southern city of Palenque on Wednesday, Lpez Obrador recounted his administrations successes in its first year and highlighted its challenges foremost surging violence. He claimed without offering any evidence that he had already done away with the high-level corruption that was rampant in previous governments, but said it was crucial to draw a bright line between criminal elements and authorities so that the two sides do not mingle as they had in the past. There was a time when Guzmn had the same power or had the influence that the then president had ... because there had been a conspiracy and that made it difficult to punish those who committed crimes. That has already become history, gone to the garbage dump of history, Lpez Obrador said.   Related: Mexico's president under pressure over 'hugs not bullets' cartel policy   It appeared to be a reference to the indictment and arrest last month of Mexicos former public safety secretary Genaro Garca Luna. Garca Luna was public safety secretary in Felipe Calderons cabinet from 2006 to 2012.

He was charged in federal court in New York with three counts of trafficking cocaine and one count of making false statements. He had been living in Florida and was arrested in Texas. US prosecutors allege he accepted millions of dollars in bribes from Guzmns Sinaloa cartel and in exchange allowed it to operate without interference. Guzmn was convicted on drug conspiracy charges in New York. He was sentenced this year to life in prison. Lpez Obrador came to power a year ago promising a hugs not bullets approach of tackling the social roots of crime instead of confronting the cartels head-on. But his vaguely defined strategy has itself come under intense criticism after a string of high-profile violent crimes, including an ambush which killed 13 state police officers, the murder of nine members of a US-Mexican family and the humiliating release of one of Guzmns sons after cartel gunmen besieged an entire city after he was briefly detained.","382"

Thousands of people have fled apocalyptic scenes, abandoning their homes and huddling on beaches to escape raging columns of flame and smoke that have plunged whole towns into darkness and destroyed more than 4m hectares of land.
Thousands of firefighters were still battling more than 100 blazes in New South Wales (NSW) state and nearly 40 in Victoria on Wednesday, with new fires being sparked daily by hot and windy conditions and, more recently, dry lightning strikes created by the fires themselves.

 Related: New year's disaster: full horror of Australia's bushfires begins to emerge  in pictures 

At the end of Australias hottest-ever decade, Canberra, the capital, was blanketed in a cloud of dense smoke that left its air quality more than 21 times the hazardous rating. The haze drifted more than 1,200 miles (2,000km) to the South Island of New Zealand, where it turned the daytime sky orange.
Fanned by soaring temperatures, strong winds and a terrible three-year drought, huge blazes have ravaged a tinder-dry landscape, causing immense destruction: since November, more than 900 homes have been lost in NSW alone.
With three months of the summer still to go, the early and devastating start to the countrys fire season has led authorities to rate it the worst on record and prompted urgent questions about whether the conservative government of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has taken enough action on global heating.

bushfires map

Polls show a large majority of Australians see the climate emergency as an urgent threat and want tougher government action, but Morrison has focused instead on the nations response to the bushfire crisis and defending Australian business, while other government officials have publicly disparaged climate activists.
In his New Years Eve address to the nation, Morrison did not make any connection between the bushfires and global heating, suggesting that while they were a terrible ordeal, Australians had faced similar trials throughout history.
Past generations had also faced natural disasters, floods, fires, global conflicts, disease and drought and overcome them, the prime minister said in a video message. That is the spirit of Australians, that is the spirit that is on display, that is a spirit that we can celebrate as Australians.
On Wednesday, he acknowledged at a reception that the fires were a time of great challenge for Australia, but deflected debate about the underlying cause of the fires, concentrating again on the nations resilience.
Fire experts and scientists have described the scale and impact of this years fires as unprecedented and said that greenhouse gas emissions, while they do not cause fires, play a proven role in raising temperatures and creating the exceptionally dry conditions that make the risk of fire extreme or catastrophic.
Although slightly cooler conditions on New Years Day gave the country a moment to take stock of the devastation, conditions were set to deteriorate again over the weekend, said the NSW state premier, Gladys Berejiklian.
Dangerous fire conditions were forecast to return to eastern Victoria and NSW on Saturday, with temperatures again likely to reach the mid-40s. We are assuming that weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday, Berejiklian said. All of us have to brace ourselves.
While most of the destruction occurred on Tuesday, the ferocity of the fires meant many people were unable to find out basic information until New Years Day. Electricity and communications lines were cut for extended periods in many areas. Roads in and out of towns remained closed.

Officials in NSW and Victoria said on Wednesday another five people were confirmed dead, and another man was presumed to have been killed. Scores more were missing and the death toll was likely to continue to rise, they said.
Three bodies were found on Wednesday at Lake Conjola on the south coast of NSW, bringing the death toll in the state to 15.
About 4,000 people in the coastal Victoria town of Mallacoota fled to the shore as winds pushed a fire toward their homes under a sky turned dark by smoke and turned red by flames. Dozens of homes burned before winds changed direction late on Tuesday, sparing the rest of the town.
Mark Tregellas, a resident who spent the night on a boat ramp, said only a late shift in the wind direction spared lives. The fire just continued to grow and then the black started to descend, he said. I couldnt see the hand in front of my face, and then it started to glow red and we knew the fire was coming.
Ash started to fall from the air and then the embers started to come down. At that point, people started to bring their kids and families into the water. Thankfully, the wind changed and the fire moved away.
The Victoria state premier, Daniel Andrews, said four people remained missing after a massive blaze ripped through Gippsland, a rural region about 310 miles (500km) east of Melbourne.
Mick Roberts from East Gippsland had been unaccounted for since Monday and was found dead in his home on Wednesday. Hes not missing any more  sorry but his body has been found in his house, his niece, Leah Parsons, said on social media.

At Malua Bay, on the NSW south coast, survivors spoke of how 1,000 people spent the night on the beach. Everyone was on the beach, just covered in ash and smoke, Al Baxter, a retired rugby union international, told Guardian Australia.
There was a strange calmness. People were as close to the waters edge as they could be. People were literally just lying on the beach trying to keep out of the smoke and ash.
Criticism of the Morrison governments climate stance has intensified as the fires have raged. Australia is the worlds largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas, but the prime minister, who won a surprise election victory in May, last month rejected calls to downsize Australias lucrative coal industry.

His government has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2030, a modest figure compared with the centre-left opposition Labor partys pledge of 45%. The leader of the minor Australian Greens party, Richard Di Natale, demanded a royal commission, the nations highest form of inquiry, on the crisis.
If he (Morrison) refuses to do so, we will be moving for a parliamentary commission of inquiry with royal commission-like powers as soon as parliament returns, Di Natale said in a statement.
Australias armed forces, including helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels, were being deployed to help fight the fires, bring water, food and fuel to towns where supplies were depleted and roads cut off, as well as evacuate residents.
Victorias emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said the 176-metre HMAS Choules, due to arrive by Friday, may be used to evacuate many of those stranded in Mallacoota, although its capacity of 1,000 people would not be enough on its own to handle everyone who needed to get out.
It doesnt have the current capacity for everyone at Mallacoota, Crisp said. We are exploring all our options  and certainly to look at evacuating some people from Mallacoota by sea is an option were seriously considering.
Besides the deployment of HMAS Choules, Australias defence force said it had been providing support to bushfire efforts in all states except Tasmania since 8 November and was dispatching Taipan, Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters plus two Spartan aircraft to Victoria, where they would help with firefighting efforts and provide humanitarian assistance to isolated communities.","1274"
"2020-01-01T19:00:12Z","media","Media","'With best wishes, Alan': what we learned from Alan Jones's furious letters to politicians","Rob, what the hell is happening with this Ritz Carlton? Were making fools of ourselves. On 6 August the broadcaster Alan Jones was writing to the New South Wales minister for planning and public spaces, Rob Stokes. Were turning Sydney into a joke. Queensland/ Brisbane are wiping the floor with us. You must rethink and this is the time for Government to make big decisions. Stop pandering to minorities. Kindest regards. With Best Wishes, Alan. Jones, the top rating talkback breakfast presenter in Sydney, is more than just a radio personality on 2GB. He has been a force in NSW politics for two decades, leveraging his top-rating show and his audience of tradies and older voters to win the attention of decision-makers in business and politics. He demands to be heard and responded to. And politicians, from prime ministers down, seem unwilling to ignore him even when there is clearly no love lost, as was the case with Malcolm Turnbull.   Related: Conspiracy, commerce and climate denial: inside the parallel universe of Alan Jones   Jones has had more than his fair share of controversies, which have led to defamation payouts, advertiser boycotts and demands from his employer, Macquarie Radio, for on-air apologies. The most recent was his remark that the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, should have a sock shoved down her throat, for which Jones was swiftly forced to apologise. A prodigious letter writer, Jones keeps up a steady dialogue with state and federal politicians. Some of this correspondence can be revealed thanks to freedom of information requests to 10 NSW ministers and five federal ministers, covering the six months after the Berejiklian government was re-elected in March. Sometimes its flattery, sometimes fatherly advice, a kind word, or a request for help for one of his listeners. But often Joness views are delivered with menace: that a failure to heed his views will lead to unspecified political pain and suffering for the individual and their party. The responses also reveal much about how politics is transacted in NSW. A disgraceful abdication and a betrayal In August, Jones returned to the airwaves after a short break and immediately took up the cause of the plan to build a tower on top of the Star casino in the inner Sydney suburb of Pyrmont. The 237m glass edifice is planned to house a six-star Ritz Carlton hotel and apartments to rival Crown casinos Barangaroo tower on the other side of Darling Harbour. The only trouble was the NSW planning department had recommended against the Stars plans. On 6 August, Jones delivered a full-throated on-air attack on Gladys Berejiklians government for its shortsightedness. Were an embarrassment, Gladys. Make a decision. Take a stand. Give the thing a go ahead and get on with it, he said on 2GB. His remarks were quickly picked up by the Daily Telegraph, which has also been an unwavering supporter of the Stars proposal. After he came off air, Jones wrote to Stokes to underscore his displeasure. But what Jones did not disclose to Stokes is that the Star is an advertiser on Macquaries 2GB or that it was about to part-fund Joness trip to Tokyo to the Rugby World Cup in late September.    The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, with the minister for planning and public spaces, Rob Stokes. Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP   Perhaps Stokes was aware of the connection between the broadcaster and the casino. The Star is disclosed on Macquarie Radios website as an advertiser, as required under the legislation colloquially known as the cash for comment rules. But Jones made no specific disclosures when berating the government on air about the Stars planned tower or when he wrote to the minister.     Stokes initially pushed back, replying quite accurately that a decision on the Star tower had not been made. But eventually action was taken to clear the way for the Stars plans. Thanks for your email, Stokes wrote. On the Star proposal, please note that a decision has not been made. The department has produced an assessment of the proposal that recommends refusal, which you can see here. The proposal has been referred to the Independent Planning Commission for a decision. Id be happy to speak with you on this if youd like some further background. But that didnt placate Jones. On 7 August, Jones took to the airwaves again to castigate the minister for not immediately approving this outstanding proposal and for the fact that its fate now rested with an independent panel. Independent panels had been set up by the Berejiklian government to address the corruption risk, amply demonstrated by the previous Labor government, when the minister was the final consent authority on major projects. Im sorry Rob Stokes, any minister so delinquent in his role should be sacked, and Im sorry Gladys, where the hell are you? Jones fumed on air. Two days later he wrote again. Rob, this is immensely damaging. Youve approved of this and been witness to it all the way. This should go ahead, I cannot believe that Government are telling Star that they cant get involved. Why did we elect people on March 18. This is a disgraceful abdication and a betrayal. And your constituency wont cop betrayal. The transcript of his on-air comments was enclosed. Stokes replied on 10 August to reveal he and the premier had met the Star, and wrote: Existing laws do not allow me to intervene in an assessment report, nor to seek to influence the Independent Planning Commission to favour a particular applicant or development application. I can however, look to review and update planning rules that might unnecessarily restrict appropriate development. Jones had been given a scoop, but didnt realise it.   I have said no more about Star than Ive said about development generally.  Alan Jones    Stokes went on to tell Jones that he and the premier had agreed to a snap review of Pyrmonts planning controls by the Greater Sydney Planning Commission of the entire Pyrmont precinct. On 19 August, Berejiklian announced the review. Pyrmont would become a vibrant residential, entertainment and innovation hub, she said. The Greater Sydney Planning Commission got the job done in just six weeks, confirming that Pyrmont should no longer be a heritage village but home to an expansion of the CBD. On 5 October, the government announced that Pyrmont was the next frontier for high rise development. Asked about the exchange, Jones told Guardian Australia: I have said no more about Star than Ive said about development generally. I have been through the Ritz-Carlton proposal every which way. I have seen what they have done at the Gold Coast and are doing in Brisbane. I have been a persistent advocate whether it be lockout laws or major projects, that we have to wake up and become an international city. Nine, which now owns Macquarie Radio, said: Alan is a passionate advocate on the issues he believes are important to Sydney. There is no link between his genuinely held opinions on development in Pyrmont and the Stars commercial arrangements with 2GB. The Star said it had a longstanding commercial relationship with Macquarie Media, but no direct agreement of any kind with Alan Jones nor any requirement for him personally to advocate for the Star.  The Australian Communications and Media Authority said it was looking into the issues raised. Thanks for the blunt reply Berejiklian herself is not on Joness mailing list. The premiers office said she had not received any correspondence or emails from the broadcaster in the six months covered by the request. The treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, the corrections minister, Anthony Roberts (who used to be known as the minister for Alan Jones when he was a staffer for John Howard) and the police minister, David Elliott, also said they had not received any. But some have very warm relations indeed. Stuart Ayres, the former sports minister, and his wife, the federal foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, are part of the Jones in-crowd.    The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, pictured with prime minister Scott Morrison, is part of the Jones in-crowd. Photograph: James D Morgan/Getty Images   Jones, Ayres and Payne share a common bond: they all own racehorses. On 25 February, in the lead-up to the March state election, Jones wrote to Ayres asking him to support grants for Australian Sailing for its new training and administration centre at Neutral Bay on Sydney harbour. The exchange demonstrates how Jones uses his influence to smooth troubled waters. Happy New Year. I dont think weve spoken  Im sure you know this is our most successful Olympic sport, Jones wrote to Ayres. And yet this is an outfit thats cash poor. Surely to God you can manage $1.3 million over four years. Hope the electorate is going well. Yell if I can help. Kindest regards. With Best Wishes, Alan. Ayres wrote a lengthy reply. To be frank, Ive found the behaviour of Sailing Australia (sic) appalling, he confided to Jones. In my view, it has done the sport an incredible disservice in NSW. Australian Sailing had failed to follow his advice and apply for various grants and had then turned on him in the media, Ayres wrote. I play politics as hard as the best of them but Ive seen more professionalism at the Cambridge Park under 8s Rugby League team, he wrote. As you can see Im quite frustrated with their behaviour and lack [of] willingness to follow any advice we provided them. Australian Sailing said it had no comment other than to note that it enjoyed a strong relationship with the NSW government. In the face of Joness interest, Ayres said he would talk to Matt Allen [president of Australian Sailing, who retired recently] about the steps they should take to repair the situation and be better placed to secure funding for their facilities and events. Ill keep you informed of how I go with Matt. Regards, Stuart. Thanks for the blunt reply, Jones wrote back. Thats why you are a very good minister. And you are on top of things. Keep me informed. I wont say anything to Matt Allen until I hear back from you. Is everything okay in the electorate? Yell out if I can help. Kindest regards. With best wishes, Alan. Jones is also close to Payne, Ayress partner. Her office told the Guardian that any correspondence that might have existed was not covered by federal freedom of information laws. That means any letters she may have received or written to Jones are personal, not ministerial, and will not be released. The Guardian has appealed against the FOI decision. What a whole heap of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo The states water minister, Melinda Pavey, does not get such an easy run. Water policy has long been an issue of interest for Jones. He grew up in rural Queensland, ran for preselection for the National party and has regularly taken up issues for farmers. In May, Pavey faced her first grilling with Jones on breakfast radio since becoming the water minister. The subject was water restrictions for Sydney. She acquitted herself without drawing Joness ire. But a few days later, she received a stern letter.    As I said to you on air this week I think water will be the single most critical issue of this governments tenure. I want to raise with you an issue brought to my attention by one of my listeners. Welcome Reef Dam.    The NSW water minister, Melinda Pavey, received a stern letter from Alan Jones. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP   Jones argued that the scheme on the Shoalhaven River, abandoned by the former premier Bob Carr in 2002, should be revived. Melinda, I just think this is something which requires a simple directive to the bureaucracy. Tell me how this can be done. Whether Pavey replied remains a mystery  her office did not produce the reply. But there was more correspondence between them about dams. Pavey replied to Jones on 12 June about Cranky Rock and Wyangala dams in the Lachlan Valley, in response to another document that could not be found. Her reply suggests Jones was advocating for the Cranky Rock dam project to go ahead. Youre correct the Lachlan Valley was identified in 2014 as one of four priority catchments for investment and delivery of critical water infrastructure projects over the next decade, Pavey wrote. But she explained that Cranky Rock had been ruled out, detailing the geological challenges,including an underlying limestone cave system. To avoid flooding the caves completely the full supply level of the dam would need to be below the bottom level of the caves, she said. Was Jones convinced? No. On 14 June he wrote back: What a whole heap of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. I wouldnt be listening to these bureaucrats, I can tell you, he told Pavey. All these dam projects should be brought together, Melinda. And you need experts outside the bureaucracy to advise. Then you order the bureaucracy to make it happen. Ill get back to you. Kindest regards. With best wishes, Alan Jones AO. I wonder whether politicians read? Andrew Constance, the transport minister, was also on the receiving end of a Jones reprimand in June over another pet subject: windfarms. The Crudine windfarm between Mudgee and Bathurst has been a particular thorn in the side of some local landholders, who have fought a vigorous campaign. Jones has taken up their cause on a number of occasions and has interviewed a local farmer, Penny Hundy. The windfarm has now been approved by both state and federal authorities, though with fewer, bigger turbines. But the company, CWP, recently needed approval to change the route for delivering the larger wind turbines to the site and to remove trees in order to widen a country road.    The NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, centre, was on the receiving end of a Jones reprimand over windfarms. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP   Jones took up the cause again. The first part of the letter lacks Joness usual rhetorical flair and appears to be a cut-and-paste of the information sent by the objectors. But it ends with a classic Jones zinger. Andrew, this appears to me to be an absolute disaster. Who can these people turn to? What on earth is going on? These people [CWP] are a law unto themselves. I look forward to hearing from you confirmation that CWP will NOT be able to alter its original route as outlined in the traffic management plan. Jones continued: Andrew, more importantly, why doesnt someone deny any approval for these wind farms? I wonder whether politicians read? Why the hell do we put people in environments where their health is at risk and keep supporting these ridiculous wind farms. Either Constance did not reply or his response is lost to history. The Crudine windfarm got permission from the Independent Planning Commission to widen the road in late June and work is proceeding. Dear Josh, what is this rubbish about? The Guardian asked five federal ministers for their correspondence with Jones. Morrison replied on Christmas Eve and produced just one heavily redacted letter. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said they had no correspondence, despite Joness on-air interest in their portfolios. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, produced one email exchange, which demonstrates every query from Jones appears to warrant a personal reply from the minister, no matter how small or misguided. In June, Jones took up the concern of a listener who had been charged a $259 supervisory levy by the Australian Tax Office on their self-managed superannuation fund, even though they had no tax to pay. Dear Josh, What is this rubbish about? A supervisory Levy? Come on. Whos going to pull the Tax Office into line? This is absurd. With Best Wishes, Alan. Frydenberg replied personally by email that the levy had been in place since 1991 and set at $259 a year since 2014-15 (for established funds). All superannuation funds are subject to a supervisory levy to fund the regulatory costs of ensuring that funds comply with their legislated obligations. He went on to detail what the charge covered, including advice and call centres. If [the owners of the fund] have any further enquiries they can contact [name redacted] in my office on [phone number]. Regards Josh.","2610"

If there was a gold medal for pre-Olympic bid hyperbole, then the states premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is already on the podium. Amid the excitement about a possible tilt by south-east Queensland at staging the Olympics in 2032, the infamous pictures of abandoned sporting venues in Athens and Rio that have come to symbolise the movements reputation for vainglorious waste dont seem to be putting anyone off in a state already saddled with big debts. But in many ways there are few countries better placed than Australia to judge the merits or otherwise of hosting the greatest show on Earth.    Annastacia Palaszczuk says the Olympic Games could be the greatest thing that ever happened in Queensland. Photograph: Jono Searle/AAP   The Sydney Olympics are still relatively fresh in the memories of many people and the physical legacy of the Games is obvious in what was once a derelict, polluted and unloved part of the city. In addition, Melbourne and Brisbane have both hosted the Commonwealth Games in the 21st century, giving Australia unprecedented experience to draw upon. South-east Queensland  comprising Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast  estimates that hosting the Olympics would cost $5.3bn (US$3.6bn), according to a feasibility study by the regions mayors.   Related: Rio's Olympic venues, six months on  in pictures   It hopes the International Olympic Committee, which under its reforming management is hoping to eradicate waste, will contribute nearly A$1.7bn amid alarm that the cost of hosting is putting cities off. After the fierce competition faced by London in bidding for 2012, the IOC reforms have streamlined the process and Paris (2024) and Los Angeles (2028) went through unopposed. The $5.3bn number appears very low compared with the current $12.5bn estimated cost for next years Tokyo Games or the similar figure for the 2012 London Games. Holding the 2016 summer Games  with the Paralympics  is widely blamed for shattering Rios economy. Financial questions will always surround the bid, although organisers will point to a Griffith University study showing that the private sector returned 70c for every dollar of the governments $1.78bn funding for the Commonwealth Games. The states GDP grew $2bn thanks to the Games, it said. The Queensland government believes that it can construct a bid that ticks many of the IOCs boxes.    Athletes during the closing ceremony at Carrara Stadium during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. Photograph: Dita Alangkara/AP   The Olympics is not what it used to be, a government spokesman said. The IOC dont want white elephants, they dont want another Birds Nest [the hugely expensive stadium built for the Beijing Games in 2008 which is now mothballed]. They dont want cities saddled with debt. The argument goes that Queensland is building roads, rail links and housing anyway, not to mention sporting facilities such as a possible aquatics centre needed by a growing population.

These include the Coomera sports complex on the Gold Coast, which has a seating capacity of 7,500 and could be used for indoor events such as basketball and handball. Planning suggests that Sydneys rowing centre at Penrith could be used if a suitable venue could not be found in Queensland. There is also the possibility of renovating the Gabba for the opening and closing ceremonies, although the main athletics stadium is likely to be built from scratch or possibly housed in an upgraded QEII stadium.   The state government claims that 80% of venues for the Games are already built, not least because of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.   The experience of the Gold Coast Games was also crucial. The Games showed the IOC that Queensland could do big events and do them well, do them under budget and do them safely, the spokesman said. They were also impressed by the friendliness of people. The 2018 Games are also a cautionary tale, however, with the decision to urge residents to avoid the city during the event backfiring. Joan Carlini, a Griffith business school lecturer, said a study showed 74% of businesses were negatively impacted by the Games and organisers failed to engage properly with communities. The Olympic bid must learn the lesson, she said, adding: If you are coming into a different town, you cant think you know more than the local community. She also said local businesses had not seen the claimed $2bn revenue from the Commonwealth Games, and warned: For the Gold Coast Games, people were compliant. But they will be much more sceptical next time.    Migaloo the white whale during the opening ceremony for the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games at Carrara Stadium. Photograph: Jono Searle/Getty Images   A cursory look at previous Olympic bids indicates that the final price tag could end up being at least double the initial estimate. Queensland taxpayers will be hoping the overshoot is not on the epic scale of the infamous 1976 games in Montreal where the cost came in at 13 times higher than forecast, bankrupting the city for years. Pasquale Sgro, a professor of economics at Deakin University, said that despite public debate often focusing on the financial angle, cost was usually a low priority for bidders. These sort of bids are done for lots of reasons such as status and reputation, Sgro said. How much money they cost is a long way down the list. These sort of large events dont really make any money. But the public like them apparently. Governments have money to spend so do you spend them on a warship or the Olympics?    Ring cycle: the mostly abandoned Olympic Aquatics stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, nine months after the Games. Photograph: Buda Mendes/Getty Images   John Fahey, who was chairman of Sydneys bid in 2000, echoed Carlinis concerns, warning that organisers have to encourage as much citizen participation as possible. Do not repeat the extraordinary mistake of the last Commonwealth Games of encouraging the locals to leave the areas of activities, he said. Queensland also has to plan early for facilities for conventions and visitors post the Games. Sydney was 10 years too late with its new convention facilities. But he emphasised that it was clear that the state could leverage the prestige conferred by the Olympics for future tourism and business opportunities, as Sydney had done. The question of status runs deep in the Olympic spirit. Queensland believes it has a good story to tell and 2032 is a chance to put the state on the world map. Sydney was known around the world, Queensland isnt. Its undiscovered, the government spokesman said. Australians know it but the rest of the world, not so much. Thats a story we want to tell because were pretty proud of where we live. But, with a joint North and South Korea bid rumoured to be in the offing for 2032, Queensland will have to tell a great story to win the bid.","1068"
"2020-01-01T19:00:12Z","lifeandstyle","Life and style","Great expectations: 'The quest for perfection has cannibalised my identity'","You need to practice self-compassion, my psychologist says to me. This is our sixth session and as per usual he is struggling to find a phrase, a point  anything  that will help me move past the need to seek perfection in every part of my life. Yes, but how? I ask, again. We talk about the usual techniques: not beating yourself up when you think youve failed; not automatically falling into a vortex of self-loathing at minor rejections. This experience does not reflect on you as a person, he repeats, explaining that what I perceive as abject failure is a mere blip on the horizon, a simple fact of life.   Related: No tricks. No mantras. I just want to learn how to do nothing: my quest to stay still   I listen hard, I really do. I understand everything he says on an intellectual level and I want to stop this ever-present stream of self-criticism before it gets too late. The problem is the quest for perfection has cannibalised my identity. Perfectionism is a personality trait but psychologists classify it as a risk factor for a host of disorders, including (but not limited to) obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, social anxiety, social phobia, body dysmorphic disorder and workaholism. It also confounds treatment. Dr Simon Sherry, a Canadian neuroscience professor and clinical psychologist, tells me perfectionists make for very difficult patients. It can sabotage treatment at every level. Perfectionists are often undone at the first stage of therapy, says Sherry. They are reluctant to seek treatment, because to do so would be to admit they have failed. And if they do manage to get themselves in front of a therapist, they tend to have unrealistically high expectations of treatment, making them more prone to giving up before therapy has time to take effect.   Clients believe that their therapist is judging them and that theyre not working hard enough in therapy  Professor Tracey Wade    They also struggle to play nicely, have intense conflictual relationships with other people and struggle to connect with others, Sherry explains. All this can interfere with helping establish the complicated alliance that needs to be built between client and therapist. Tracey Wade is a professor of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide and a leader in the study of perfectionism. When I call her up to talk she is preparing a training session on how psychologists and therapists can best treat perfectionism. What usually interferes with perfectionists getting better is that they tend to block therapy, she tells me. Clients believe that their therapist is judging them and that theyre not working hard enough in therapy. According to psychologists Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, there are three types of perfectionists: the self-oriented type who keep strict standards for themselves and are motivated by avoiding failure at all costs; the other-oriented type who set perfectionist expectations for others; and the socially prescribed form who believe that others expect them to be perfect. While people can suffer from a mixture of all three, each type is enough to cause a high level of anxiety on its own.   I dont understand why therapy is not playing along  Caroline Zielinski    Ive lost count of how many psychologists Ive seen over my lifetime. All I know is that its roughly an equal number of men and women, aged between 35 and 60. They have ranged from formal and less formal; their treatment approaches have varied from cognitive behavioural therapy to experimental exercises designed to reprogram my brain to work for me, rather than against me. Some have given me books; others have told me to stop reading into it. What can I say that will make you feel better? my current psychologist asked me at our last session. Id been crying again and he was running out of ideas of how to help me. Youre supposed to come out of these sessions feeling better, not worse. Im waiting for you to say that one phrase that will make it all click for me, I replied. There is no one thing that will help  you have to start small. I left feeling more frustrated than ever before. In the past, Id been able to change some of my more destructive habits after having one conversation, so I dont understand why therapy is not playing along.   Young people are evaluated in a host of new ways ... they are rated, ranked and tested on every single thing they do  Professor Andrew Hill    While perfectionism has always existed, never before have we seen it manifest itself so strongly in one generation. After conducting one of the largest-ever studies on perfectionism, Sherry and his colleague Dr Martin Smith found that perfectionism has increased substantially over the past 25 years, and that it affects men and women equally. Its also on the rise among young people: after analysing data from 41,641 American, Canadian and British college students, taken from the late 1980s to 2016, Professors Andrew Hill and Thomas Curran from York St John University found that over the study period, the self-oriented perfectionism scores increased by 10%; socially prescribed increased by 33%; and other-oriented increased by 16%. Hill, the co-author of a significant paper looking at the rise of perfectionism, says in our market-based society, the pressure for young people to demonstrate their value and outperform their peers is so immense it often leads to them, and their parents, to strive towards totally unrealistic goals. In this new society young people are evaluated in a host of new ways  almost every aspect of their lives is turned into metrics, and they are rated, ranked and tested on every single thing they do, down to how they look. Perfectionism is also partly genetic, and it is also strongly influenced by the environment a child grows up in. Sherry says that over time children internalise the conditions put on them by perfectionist parents and then take them into their own relationships. We need to encourage parents to love their children unconditionally, he tells me. We dont want parents to react catastrophically to minor mistakes that their children make and see minor mistakes as massive problems. According to Sherry, loving your children in proportion to their achievements (such as only rewarding them when they get high marks) over time leads to them internalising these conditions, and then crashing in terms of their self-esteem and mood when they dont get a promotion, or a sought-after achievement. This is not just a low mood: people who are perfectionists are at higher risk of suicide, and are more likely to drop out, self-criticise and suffer from a lack of self-compassion. So is there hope?   Its all about changing your mindset from 'must' to 'it would be nice'   Over time Ive come to realise that the biggest obstacle to my own treatment is the belief that perfectionism fuels my ambition. I didnt take the problem seriously. For years, I wore my perfectionism like a badge of honour. I strive for perfection, I told myself, which means my standards are extremely high and will result in higher-quality work. While I did achieve high results, Im starting to realise this may be in spite of and not because of my perfectionistic tendencies. Wade says fear is a strong motivator for perfectionists, and people are afraid to let it go because of their belief it achieves things for them. So how do you convince a perfectionist that what they consider to be a high standard and being productive is actually unattainable? Most studies and clinical observations show that perfectionism is the opposite of productivity, Sherry says. Perfectionists tend to have more episodes of depression, be more absent and are prone to negative emotions such as guilt and anxiety. Over time, perfectionists may start to unravel  they become less conscientious, organised, disciplined, reliable and goal-focused, and more neurotic and emotionally unstable. I ask all the experts if there is a way to change the belief that perfectionism is fundamental to success. To truly change it  not just intellectually  but deep within your heart. For Wade, its all about changing your mindset from must to it would be nice. Research shows that when you start to change your thinking from should to it would be nice, but its not the end of the world, it becomes more about excellence rather than perfectionism. For Hill, its about deriving value in yourself by what you add to others, and perhaps hes right. Perhaps shifting the outlook from bettering ourselves to helping others is the ultimate antidote to a society where individualism  and the insatiable need to be the best  has caused far more harm that we ever anticipated. So as we continue to navigate a system that sets us up for failure  all the while demanding success at every turn  its worth asking ourselves: how far are we willing to go to present as the perfect human? And in the end, is it worth it? As someone in the midst of it, I can honestly say no.","1416"

Prior to beginning my sabbatical stay in Sydney, I took the opportunity this holiday season to vacation in Australia with my family. We went to see the Great Barrier Reef  one of the great wonders of this planet  while we still can. Subject to the twin assaults of warming-caused bleaching and ocean acidification, it will be gone in a matter of decades in the absence of a dramatic reduction in global carbon emissions. We also travelled to the Blue Mountains, another of Australias natural wonders, known for its lush temperate rainforests, majestic cliffs and rock formations and panoramic vistas that challenge any the world has to offer. It too is now threatened by climate change. I witnessed this firsthand. I did not see vast expanses of rainforest framed by distant blue-tinged mountain ranges. Instead I looked out into smoke-filled valleys, with only the faintest ghosts of distant ridges and peaks in the background. The iconic blue tint (which derives from a haze formed from terpenes emitted by the Eucalyptus trees that are so plentiful here) was replaced by a brown haze. The blue sky, too, had been replaced by that brown haze. The locals, whom I found to be friendly and outgoing, would volunteer that they have never seen anything like this before. Some even uttered the words climate change without any prompting. The songs of Peter Garrett and Midnight Oil I first enjoyed decades ago have taken on a whole new meaning for me now. They seem disturbingly prescient in light of what we are witnessing unfold in Australia. The brown skies I observed in the Blue Mountains this week are a product of human-caused climate change. Take record heat, combine it with unprecedented drought in already dry regions and you get unprecedented bushfires like the ones engulfing the Blue Mountains and spreading across the continent. Its not complicated.  The smoke is so thick in Katoomba tourists are opting for photos with billboards, rather than the Three Sisters themselves. @abcsydney pic.twitter.com/MOWvH8UBgs— Tom Lowrey (@tomlowrey) December 30, 2019  The warming of our planet  and the changes in climate associated with it  are due to the fossil fuels were burning: oil, whether at midnight or any other hour of the day, natural gas, and the biggest culprit of all, coal. Thats not complicated either. When we mine for coal, like the controversial planned Adani coalmine, which would more than double Australias coal-based carbon emissions, we are literally mining away at our blue skies. The Adani coalmine could rightly be renamed the Blue Sky mine.  In Australia, beds are burning. So are entire towns, irreplaceable forests and endangered and precious animal species such as the koala (arguably the worlds only living plush toy) are perishing in massive numbers due to the unprecedented bushfires. The continent of Australia is figuratively  and in some sense literally  on fire. Yet the prime minister, Scott Morrison, appears remarkably indifferent to the climate emergency Australia is suffering through, having chosen to vacation in Hawaii as Australians are left to contend with unprecedented heat and bushfires. Morrison has shown himself to be beholden to coal interests and his administration is considered to have conspired with a small number of petrostates to sabotage the recent UN climate conference in Madrid (COP25), seen as a last ditch effort to keep planetary warming below a level (1.5C) considered by many to constitute dangerous planetary warming. But Australians need only wake up in the morning, turn on the television, read the newspaper or look out the window to see what is increasingly obvious to many  for Australia, dangerous climate change is already here. Its simply a matter of how much worse were willing to allow it to get. Australia is experiencing a climate emergency. It is literally burning. It needs leadership that is able to recognise that and act. And it needs voters to hold politicians accountable at the ballot box. Australians must vote out fossil-fuelled politicians who have chosen to be part of the problem and vote in climate champions who are willing to solve it.

"2020-01-01T19:00:12Z","environment","Environment","Queensland government was warned about risks of Chinese company's water extraction","Queensland government experts raised repeated warnings about the long-term sustainability of groundwater extraction at a southern Queensland property which has since been approved to operate as a commercial water mine. The approval for the 96m litre a year bottled water extraction operation at Cherrabah  in a severely drought-hit area where locals are on water rations and communities at imminent risk of running dry  has raised significant questions about the oversight and regulation of critical water resources in Queensland. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia show how longstanding concerns about groundwater security at Cherrabah were overridden by changes to Queensland law enacted by Campbell Newmans government in 2013.   Related: In Australia's drought towns, angry residents rely on charity, not government, for water   Under the changes, the Chinese-owned company Joyful View Garden Real Estate Development Resort Pty Ltd was automatically granted a 94-year extraction permit at Cherrabah when a short-term allocation expired in 2017. Written concerns outlined in the documents obtained by Guardian Australia include the expert review of a study commissioned by Joyful View in 2009 that was the basis for its subsequent water extraction applications. The study contained repeated qualifications that its modelling could not be relied upon for a period longer than 12 months. One bureaucrat detailed not small or irrelevant errors in that study, including that it overstated the amount of rainfall recharge to groundwater by a factor of almost 20. The public servant, whose name is redacted from the document, calculated an annual recharge of 40m litres  less than half the Cherrabah allocation. Another public servant, the principal natural resource officer for groundwater, wrote that he had concerns about Joyful View, which at the time had wanted the allocation to support plans for a massive resort development. He raised concerns the company might seek to exert political pressure to gain the permit. In October 2008 I wrote to the company and set out, amongst other things, the range of information that would be required to support consideration for an application for an increased water entitlement, the public servant said. I have continually referenced the need for caution in the development and use of groundwater from the type of aquifer systems existing on Cherrabah. Risks associated with limited storage, limited recharge potential, boundary conditions under pumping, bore interference etc have been raised time and time again. Cherrabah management and owners  have little understanding of groundwater. Unfortunately they maintain a simple approach that wet bores are just that and they need not concern themselves about issues of sustainability. In another email, the manager writes: Every opportunity has been taken to urge them to be more cautious and pessimistic rather than the apparent exuberant optimism they hold regarding water supply availability. I will certainly be looking for counsel in this case as [name redacted] might call in political support for his multi-million development proposal at Cherrabah if it hangs off an entitlement decision. I can imagine a debacle if we approve  [and] their underpinning source of water supply fails. The department decided in 2010 to grant Joyful View a short-term permit of 50m litres a year  a quarter of the amount it wanted  and intended to undertake detailed monitoring and assessment of the borefield in order to reassess the situation when the licence expired in 2017. Joyful View appealed that decision and in 2012 was granted 96m litres a year on the basis of advice by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The Newman governments changes to the Water Act meant the allocation was effectively made permanent with no review of monitoring data, and no additional study to assess drawdown effects. The way Joyful View gained approval to mine water  amid sustainability concerns and with relatively little scrutiny of the impact on groundwater  has further raised concern about the extent to which other extraction operations, particularly irrigators and pastoralists, might be operating in a manner that is compounding the effects of the drought.   Related: Running on empty: Tamborine Mountain and the growing anger over water mining   The Southern Downs deputy mayor, Jo McNally, told a recent meeting the council was aware of many property owners extracting water and selling it outside the region, but could do nothing to stop it. A 2018 Queensland background paper on groundwater in the Upper Condamine area shows about 9bn litres a year allocated in the Warwick area, but the actual groundwater take is unknown, because bores for stock and domestic use do not require authorisation. There are more than 900 irrigators in the Condamine Balonne underground water management area and many pump unrestricted, without meters. Earlier this year state proposals to place meters on bores and restrict groundwater pumping were met with significant resistance by farmers. Licences also come with no restrictions on how the water is used. Joyful View had wanted to use its water to support a resort development the size of a small town. Its current plan  to truck water to a Gold Coast bottling plant  requires no additional state approval. Members of the Southern Downs regional council, which approved the facility this month, a day before placing residents on extreme water restrictions, have said they have no control over the water or its use, and do not have grounds to refuse a development on that basis. Attempts were made to contact Joyful View for comment.","857"
"2020-01-01T19:00:12Z","science","Science","Protein tangles in Alzheimer's patients could help predict brain shrinkage","Tangles of a protein found inside the brain cells of people with Alzheimers disease can be used to predict future brain shrinkage, research suggests.  In healthy people, a protein called tau is important in supporting the internal structure of brain cells. However, in those with Alzheimers, chemical changes take place that cause the protein to form tangles that disrupt the cells. Such tangles have previously been linked to a loss of brain cells. Now scientists have used imaging techniques to track the extent of tau tangles in the brains of those with early signs of Alzheimers, revealing that levels of the protein predict not only how much brain shrinkage will subsequently occur, but where. Our study supports the notion that tau pathology accumulates upstream of brain tissue loss and clinical symptoms, said Prof Gil Rabinovici, a co-author of the research from the University of California, San Francisco.   Related: Research shines light on why women more likely to develop Alzheimer's   A number of drugs targeting tau tangles are currently in clinical trials, including some that aim to interfere with the production of tau in the brain or its spread between cells. Dr Renaud La Joie, another author of the research, said the findings suggested the imaging technique could prove valuable both in choosing which patients to enrol to test such drugs and in monitoring whether the drugs work. Dr Laura Phipps, of Alzheimers Research UK, said: The ability to track tau in the brain will be critical for testing treatments designed to prevent the protein causing damage, and the scans used in this study could be an important tool for future clinical trials. Writing in the journal Science Translational Medicine, La Joie and colleagues report how they used an imaging technique called positron emission tomography (Pet) to study the brains of 32 people aged between 49 and 83 who were in the early stages of showing Alzheimers symptoms. Pet imaging involves injecting patients with a substance that contains a radioactive atom. The area in which the substance clusters shows up in subsequent scans. The scientists used one substance that attaches to plaques of a protein in the brain known as beta amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimers disease, and another recently developed substance that attaches to tau tangles. They took a Pet scan at the start of the study, as well as an MRI, which reveals the structure of the brain. A second MRI was taken 15 months later to track brain atrophy. The results reveal the level and location of tau tangles shown by the Pet scan at the outset were closely linked to shrinkage of grey matter in the brain, both in terms of the degree of shrinkage and its location. Such patterns explained about 40% of the variation in shrinkage. By contrast, there was little sign of a link between brain shrinkage and the extent of beta amyloid shown by Pet scan. The findings held even when the thickness of the brains grey matter at the start of the study was taken into account, and when the age of participants was considered.   Related: Radical light and sound wave therapy could slow Alzheimer's   Although previous research has suggested brain atrophy shows a stronger link to tau tangles than beta amyloid, the team say the findings were still a surprise. We were amazed by how well tau predicted not only the degree of atrophy overall, but the precise location of atrophy in individual patients, said La Joie.  But, he added, the lack of a link to signs of beta amyloid does not mean those plaques are not harmful. It is extremely rare to see significant amounts of tau tangles across the brain in patients with no amyloid: for some reason, amyloid seems almost necessary for tau to build up in the cortex, said La Joie. The study has limitations, including that the Pet scan gives only an indirect measure of levels of tau and beta amyloid, and the tracking substances might not bind only to those proteins. This relatively small study adds to evidence that tau may drive the death of brain cells, and could explain why symptoms get worse as tau spreads through the brain, said Phipps. While the majority of volunteers in the study were under the age of 65, making it harder to generalise the findings to everyone with the disease, the study highlights the importance of focusing future research efforts on the tau protein.  This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to give the full name of the imaging technique as positron emission tomography and to render it after first mention as Pet in accordance with style guidelines.","754"

I think the VAR should change their name because video assistant referee, thats not true. It should be VR, video referees, because they are the referees, they are the assistant. It is strange because you see the referees on the pitch and they are not the referees, they are the assistant referees.

Hes always injured, Mourinho said. Hes injured, he plays one match, [the] next week he is injured. We are full of hope since the beginning of the season. It is a concern. You think you have a player, you think you have a player in the evolution process, he plays very well against Norwich, you are full of hope that he is ready for it but he is not ready for it.

The murder investigation was launched after Derbyshire constabulary were called to a house in New Zealand Lane at 4.11am on Wednesday, where they found a man and a woman fatally injured. A 39-year-old man was arrested on the scene on suspicion of two counts of murder and remains in custody. Officers confirmed that there were no other people present in the property at the time. One of the victims has been widely named in the media as Helen Almey, 39, and it is believed that the other victim was her partner of six months. Almey had three children under 10 with her estranged husband. A former student at Loughborough University, Almey was a part-time PE teacher and locals said she played a key role in the community, helping out with the neighbourhood watch and playing for sport teams. A car was seen being taken away by police from New Zealand Lane at around 2pm and a forensic tent was erected within the security cordon during the morning. The East Midlands Ambulance Service said: We received a call at 4.30am  from our colleagues in Derbyshire police requesting medical assistance at a private address in Duffield. We sent a paramedic in a car and two crewed ambulances. In a later statement, Derbyshire constabulary said: Detectives investigating what happened at the house in New Zealand Lane have said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths and there was no one else in the property at the time. Formal identification of the victims has yet to take place and specially trained liaison officers are supporting their families. New Zealand Lane has been closed while police investigate and they have thanked residents for their patience and understanding.","309"

The universitys history department has told students looking for somewhere quiet to revise during the January exam period that they can reserve desks at the site in Bristol harbour where Isambard Kingdom Brunels steamship is housed in a dry dock, more than a mile from their campus across the Avon. The students were told in an email that they would have exclusive use of a reading room at the site, along with discounted rates on food and drink at the attractions cafe.   Related: 'It's party central': the Bristol residents fed up with noisy student neighbours   Overcrowding at Bristols main campus libraries has resulted in students queueing from 7am in order to get desks. Before last summers exams, students complained that library study spaces were often all taken shortly after the doors opened at 8am, and that overcrowding had got worse as a result of the universitys rapid expansion. Cameron Scheijde, who graduated from Bristol last summer, said the problem had got much worse during his three years as an undergraduate starting in autumn 2016. In my first year you could get to the library at 8am in exam season, basically January and May, and find a desk by 8am with no problem, and it would be full by 11am. But this [past] year, by 8.30am every library place was taken, Scheijde said. A current economics student, who did not wish to be named, said: The arts and social sciences library is far too small. There are rarely any seats free during normal working hours and they only become free overnight. That encourages people to work late into the night or do all-nighters, which is clearly unhealthy. It has grown aggressively since the introduction of 9,000 annual tuition fees in 2012 and the removal of the governments cap on undergraduate numbers. In the 2012-13 academic year Bristol had the equivalent of 18,000 full-time students on undergraduate and postgraduate courses. By 2018-19 it had almost 24,000  an increase of nearly a third. While the universitys marketing says: Bristol is small enough to feel warm and friendly, Scheijde said the effect of the increased student numbers could be felt across the campus. It wasnt just libraries; it was in classes as well. In my first year seminars had eight to 10 students; by my third year it was up to 30. When seminars are that big you cant contribute much. I liked my lecturers, they were good and they knew what they were talking about. But there was definitely less one-to-one [contact] as time went on, he said. A spokesperson for the university said: We appreciate that study spaces are always in high demand in the run-up to exams and we encourage our students to make use of all the study spaces available including our libraries which run extended opening hours. For history students the school has been able to offer additional study space in the Brunel Institute on Bristol Harbourside which is in close proximity to the main campus.   Related: Demolition of Bristol eyesore makes way for university campus   The university is proposing a new library for its central campus, costing 80m and including 2,000 study spaces. But it has not yet applied for planning permission and the building will not open until the end of 2023 at the earliest. Last year the Guardian reported that the university was funding special police patrols in parts of Bristol with large student populations in response to complaints from residents about noisy parties, student drunkenness and antisocial behaviour. At the start of the current academic year Bristol was criticised for offering some first-year undergraduates bedrooms in accommodation as far away as Newport in Wales, 30 miles from its main campus. Despite its growing pains the university intends to keep expanding: it is advancing with plans to build a huge complex near Temple Meads railway station in the city, renovating a derelict industrial site while adding a further 3,000 students.","659"

I know others have had a similar experience, so this alone could account for the BBC receiving a larger number of formal complaints about anti-Conservative coverage than anti-Labour (BBC bias: Tory voters more likely to complain en masse, 31 December). Conservatives are perhaps also more likely to be anti the BBC per se, thus generating a greater likelihood of complaints being made. With print media overwhelmingly dominated by rightwing conservative interests, it is essential for democracy that our flagship public-service broadcaster provides some kind of countervailing balance. Historically, this was indeed a role that the BBC discharged reasonably well  being a key factor in the election of a number of Labour governments since 1964. Without a relatively neutral broadcast media, Labour will always start with a massive handicap; it has a mountain to climb just to get over the line. Its just not good enough that, in a year or two, independent academic research reports will conclusively demonstrate the BBCs anti-Labour bias. When voters access to unbiased information is compromised in this way, democracy itself is gravely threatened. For when a government is elected to absolute power, carried over the line by bias and propaganda, its very legitimacy is in severe doubt  with grave implications for the sheer governability of a deeply disgruntled, disenfranchised citizenry.Dr Richard HouseStroud, Gloucestershire  In search of balance, during the recent general election the BBC repeatedly gave too much prominence to the unsupported assumptions of Brexit supporters, the rightwing media and a certain Downing Street source, and too little to stating established facts. Opponents of Brexit see bias in the former; supporters of Brexit see it in the latter. Based on this, some have attempted to defend the BBCs recent output by saying that if both sides attack you, you are doing it right. In fact, when one side lies all the time and the other does not, then being attacked by both sides means you are charting a path somewhere between truth and lies, and need to do better. For far too long, the BBC and others made similar mistakes over climate science coverage. The solution is simple  to quote Garry Kasparov: Just keep repeating the facts. Stop giving equal times to lies.Dr Richard MilneEdinburgh  Tony Hall would do well to read Prof Steve Joness 2011 report on the BBCs science coverage (Election coverage was not biased, says Hall, 23 December). As noted by Diane Coyle, a former vice-chair of the BBC Trust, which commissioned the report, it highlighted the danger of this false-balance interpretation of its editorial requirement of due impartiality. Jones wrote: Attempts to give a place to anyone, however unqualified, who claims interest can make for false balance  and the opposite of impartiality. I assume the report was ignored by the BBCs politics staff because it is about science, but wider reading of it might help the BBCs coverage generally.Philip CunninghamLondon  Join the debate  email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  Read more Guardian letters  click here to visit gu.com/letters  Do you have a photo youd like to share with Guardian readers?

If anything its the opposite  FPTP in the UK is visibly biased in favour of Labour, and the Conservatives often have to poll much harder for an equivalent output in the Commons. The Tories may have won in 2019, but actually by a much narrower margin than is strictly equitable  in terms of vote share, more people actually voted for Boris Johnson (43.6%) than Tony Blair in 1997 (43.2%), but the Conservatives ended up with over 50 fewer seats than Labour did in its famous landslide (365 compared with 418). In 1983, the year of the longest suicide note in history (since Jeremy Corbyns defeat, now the second-longest), Michael Foots Labour polled worse than the Conservatives did in their calamitous 1997 wipeout (27.6% against 30.7%) yet still ended up with substantially more seats (209 to John Majors 165). When Tony Blair polled 40.7% of the vote in 2001 he crushed the Conservatives with a second landslide of 413 seats, but even though Theresa May easily beat him with 42.7% of the vote in 2017 she only scraped 317 seats and lost her parliamentary majority. First-past-the-post results appear inequitable not because of an establishment conspiracy  as we can see, the system works against the Tories more often than not  but because the local picture is a variegated one. Dismissing Tory success as a rigged game is not only untrue but betrays a head-in-the-sand refusal to engage constructively with other reasons for defeat and will only lead the Greens, Labour, and all progressive parties to another failure next time.Robert FrazerStockport, Cheshire  Join the debate  email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  Read more Guardian letters  click here to visit gu.com/letters  Do you have a photo youd like to share with Guardian readers?

The deaths included three British Airways cabin crew, all in their 20s, killed in a single crash in Surrey on New Years Eve and a 19-year-old killed in Derry, Northern Ireland, in another collision. Elsewhere a woman on a mobility scooter in Staffordshire was killed in a suspected hit and run.  In the incident in Surrey, three people died and a fourth was seriously injured in a collision between a lorry and a car at a junction in the village of Stanwell. BA confirmed the victims were members of cabin crew, saying: Were deeply saddened to learn of the death of our colleagues involved in a road traffic collision last night. Our thoughts are with their family and friends. Emergency services were called shortly after 11.30pm to a crash involving a Mercedes HGV and a Toyota Yaris. The HGV left the road and ended up in Longford River. Two men aged 25 and 23 and a woman aged 20 who were in the Yaris died at the scene. Another 25-year-old woman in the Yaris, who also worked as cabin crew for BA, is in hospital in a serious condition. The site is close to Heathrow airport. It is believed that all four cabin crew were friends and two of them had finished work at about 6pm, while the others were on a day off and not scheduled to be on duty.

Campaigners for immigrants rights were sent a fully redacted list of nations in different categories of risk, which were entirely blacked out, on a Home Office response to their legal challenge over the artificial intelligence programme. In defence of its use of the AI system a Home Office spokesperson said the programme fully complied with equality legislation. Foxglove, an advocacy group promoting justice in the new technology sector, is supporting the case brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) to force the Home Office to explain on what basis the algorithm streams visa applicants. Responding to a letter from the JCWI as part of a pre-legal action move, the Home Office admitted that it decides who gets into the UK on the visa system through nationality. But Foxglove said the Home Office refused to publish its list of what the campaign group labelled the undesirable nations in its correspondence to them and the JCWI. The list provided to us is entirely redacted, said Cori Crider, a director at Foxglove. Boris Johnson claims he wants people of talent coming into Britain, but the Home Offices secret list of undesirable countries sure makes it look like its visa algorithm is a convenient way of keeping people of colour out. Chai Patel, JCWIs legal policy director, added: We know from the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration that Home Office enforcement activity is primarily targeted at only a few nationalities that are easy to remove, so it is likely that information about high risk nationalities will be biased by definition. We also know that Home Office databases are full of errors, and decisions are hugely flawed with 52% of appeals against Home Office decision-making being ruled incorrect. Algorithms, and streaming tools are only ever as good as the data that goes into them: if discriminatory data and decisions go in, then that is what you will get out. But the Home Office defended the use of the AI tool, stressing that the final decision on entry to the UK was made by immigration officers. A Home Office spokesperson said: As the public would expect, we have always used processes that enable UK Visas and Immigration to allocate its high volume of cases in an efficient way. The streaming tool, first developed in 2015, attributes a risk rating to an application based on a number of criteria, including nationality, and this rating is used to allocate work to caseworkers, not decide the application. Every application is decided by an entry clearance officer. The tool complies fully with the relevant legislation under the Equality Act 2010. The Home Office spokesperson added that UK Visas and Immigration received more than 3.3 million visa applications in the year ending June 2019, of which just under 2.9 million were granted. The service standard for processing a visit visa is 15 working days. Last year we processed 97% within this target. The UK welcomes genuine visitors. Over 2.4 million visitor visas were granted, for leisure, study or business, an increase of 8% in the past year. In its legal action the JCWI is demanding all the technical details that drive the streaming tool be revealed, along with further information such as case-working targets in each of the three categories, and if there have been any complaints about the deployment of the algorithm. The campaign group argues that the use of the streaming tool is a more modern version of a visa entry system ruled unlawful by the House of Lords in 2005. It concerned Roma applicants who were said to have been treated with more suspicion and subjected to more intense and intrusive questioning than non-Roma applicants. The Lords concluded that the stereotyping of Roma as being less likely to be genuine visitors to the UK was unlawful.","664"

The shadow Treasury minister said he would not fall out with fellow hopefuls while the party undergoes what he described as an existential crisis. His remarks came in a complaint on Twitter over being contacted by the media to ask whether he agreed with the party chair, Ian Lavery, on why it lost the election so dramatically. Lewis said setting out the divisions among people interested in the top job was not befitting of a party seeking to rebuild.   Related: These are the questions Labour must answer if it is ever to win again | Martin Kettle   Lavery  who supports Brexit and represents Wansbeck, a leave-voting seat in Northumberland  is a staunch supporter of Corbyn. He is tipped to run for the leadership himself and said in a piece in the Daily Mirror that Labour lost the election because of its position on the EU, infighting in the party and a lack of trust among voters that it could deliver its manifesto promises. Lewis said he did not disagree with Lavery on how much rebuilding the party needed to do and would not be drawn into creating splits on how the party must change. He tweeted: Whilst I dont agree with everything hes said I do agree with parts of his analysis. So perhaps if all we use the coming elections [to succeed Corbyn] as a lens through which to listen to each other, we can work out a path ahead.

As such, when youre hanging by the fingernails on a cliff edge, its usually not a good time to start fighting with those dangling with you. Far better is to help each other work out the way back up the cliff face. Lewis, a former army reservist, was the second Labour MP to announce he wanted to run for leader, following the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry. There are concerns Lewis might split the vote of leftwing members should he make it on to the ballot paper, potentially drawing support away from the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey. Thornberry wrote a lengthy Facebook message about her foreign policy priorities on New Years Day, taking a swipe at Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. She has been a regular critic of the US president, branding him a sexual predator and racist, and saying he is not welcome in the UK. She wrote on Facebook: Finally, I hope in November, our long global nightmare will be over and Donald Trump will be dumped out of office by the American people, and we will finally see the United States resume its role as a global leader on the issues that matter to us all. Whats more, Trumps defeat would hopefully turn the tide on his vicious band of so-called populist imitators around the globe, including our current PM. Thornberry regularly faced Johnson at the despatch box in the Commons when he was foreign secretary and has written of the need for someone with confidence and forensic skill to take him on in the chamber.","524"
"2020-01-01T18:00:10Z","society","Society","AI system outperforms experts in spotting breast cancer","An artificial intelligence program has been developed that is better at spotting breast cancer in mammograms than expert radiologists.
The AI outperformed the specialists by detecting cancers that the radiologists missed in the images, while ignoring features they falsely flagged as possible tumours.
If the program proves its worth in clinical trials, the software, developed by Google Health, could make breast screening more effective and ease the burden on health services such as the NHS where radiologists are in short supply.
This is a great demonstration of how these technologies can enable and augment the human expert, said Dominic King, the UK lead at Google Health. The AI system is saying I think there may be an issue here, do you want to check?
About one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Screening programmes catch more than 18,000 cases each year in England alone, but tumours are still missed, giving false negative results, and some women are wrongly suspected of having cancer, in false positives that lead to unnecessary anxiety and invasive biopsies.
Googles AI program analyses mammograms in three different ways before combing the results to produce an overall risk score. The scientists trained the program on mammograms from more than 76,000 women in the UK and 15,000 women in the US. To see how well it worked, they then asked it to assess nearly 30,000 new mammograms from UK and US women who either had biopsy-confirmed cancer, or no signs of cancer during follow-up at least a year later.
In the US, women who go for breast cancer screening tend to be seen every one or two years and their mammograms are examined by a single radiologist. When compared with the US system, the AI produced 5.7% fewer false positives and 9.4% fewer false negatives.
In the UK, women are screened less often, typically once every three years, but their mammograms are reviewed by two radiologists, and sometimes a third in case of disagreement. The AI performed only marginally better than the UK system, reducing false positives by 1.2% and false negatives by 2.7%.
The results suggest the AI could boost the quality of breast cancer screening in the US and maintain the same level in the UK, with the AI assisting or replacing the second radiologist.
Breast cancer screening in the UK is under particular strain. The Royal College of Radiologists has identified a shortfall of at least 1,104 radiologists. In breast radiology specifically, 8% of hospital posts are unfilled, with much of the shortage due to older radiologists retiring from the NHS faster than new ones join.





Artificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. 





Chris Kelly, a clinician scientist at Google Health, said the next major step would be a trial to assess the AI in real-world conditions. Its performance could slip when it is fed images from different mammogram systems. In the latest study, reported in Nature, nearly all of the images came from machines provided by one manufacturer.
Like the rest of the health service, breast imaging, and UK radiology more widely, is understaffed and desperate for help, said Dr Caroline Rubin, vice-president for clinical radiology at the Royal College of Radiologists. AI programs will not solve the human staffing crisis, as radiologists and imaging teams do far more than just look at scans, but they will undoubtedly help by acting as a second pair of eyes and a safety net.
It is a competitive market for developers and these programs will need to be rigorously tested and regulated first. The next step for promising products is for them to be used in clinical trials, evaluated in practice and used on patients screened in real-time, a process that will need to be overseen by the UK public health agencies that have overall responsibility for the breast screening programmes.
Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UKs chief executive, said: Screening helps diagnose breast cancer at an early stage, when treatment is more likely to be successful, ensuring more people survive the disease. But it also has harms such as diagnosing cancers that would never have gone on to cause any problems and missing some cancers. This is still early stage research, but it shows how AI could improve breast cancer screening and ease pressure off the NHS.","709"

He was delighted to get a win out of Protektorat in the opening novice hurdle, only to lose the race in the stewards room, where he was handed a four-day whip ban into the bargain. Three races later, he was wreathed in smiles after Oldgrangewood delivered his trademark strong finish to prevail by inches over Saint Calvados and Lalor in the Paddy Power Handicap Chase.Its been a funny old hour, Skelton said, having clearly learned restraint and understatement from his many years in the saddle. He and his brother Dan, in Florida on holiday, are expected to appeal the disqualification of Protektorat, even though it means an unwanted return to the High Holborn offices of the BHA, where Harry spent an entire day just before Christmas appealing a 10-day riding ban, successfully. Protektorat was judged to have taken the ground of Imperial Alcazar, who was switched by Paddy Brennan and finished well to be beaten just a head. Brennan never stopped riding in the incident at the final flight, leading to many surprised faces when the verdict was announced.The inquiry was an early blooding for the new chief steward, the South African Shaun Parker, on his first day working at a British racecourse. But his colleague, Simon Cowley, insisted the decision did not represent new thinking on the interference rules.Although Protektorat has not made contact with Imperial Alcazar, hes forced Paddy Brennan to come off his intended running line, costing him momentum and a little ground, Cowley said. We take that into account and also the fact that Brennans mount was making ground all the way to the line and, possibly a stride after the line, he was in front. We think that what happened cost him more than the distance he was beaten. Skelton was cautioned for careless riding.Sometimes the game gives back to those who have been wronged and so it was for connections of Doing Fine, who won the voided London National. Now 12, the horse had enough left to prevail in the Markel Insurance Chase under his young pilot, Philip Donovan.Meanwhile, Al Boum Photo enjoyed a winning reappearance at Tramore and was shortened from 8-1 to 6-1 for a repeat victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

The three brands, which are part of Lloyds Banking Group, apologised repeatedly to customers after the problem started at about 4am on New Years Day, a bank holiday when branches are shut. They put out the same statement on Twitter on Wednesday morning: We know our customers are having issues with internet and mobile banking. Were sorry about this and were working to have it back to normal soon. By lunchtime the three brands said internet and mobile banking were back to normal. They tweeted: Were sorry for the issues with it this morning. Thanks for your messages.   Related: Convenience stores urge Link to scrap further ATM fee cuts   The issue prevented customers from logging in via the web and the mobile app. Telephone banking, card payments and ATM transactions were not affected. The bank said it was an internal problem, not a cybersecurity one, which its IT team had now fixed. With 22 million current account customers, Lloyds Banking Group is the UKs largest provider and also offers the most basic bank accounts. It has 13 million active online customers, of which more than 9 million are mobile users. All of them were potentially affected. A spokeswoman was unable to say whether customers would receive any compensation but added that anyone who had incurred charges as a result of the outage should get in touch with their bank. Angry customers reported on social media that they could not access banking services from their computers or smartphones and had been locked out of their accounts for hours. Many also complained that they had not been given a timescale for when online services would be back up and running again. Customers were told to call their bank if they needed to transfer funds urgently, but some said they were unable to get through, and complained they were put on hold for a long time before being cut off. One customer asked Lloyds whether it would waive his overdraft fee, and the bank told him to raise this with its customer service team.  Due to this issue, can you waive my OD fee? Yes or no will be appericated. Not palm me to a phone number. Thank you.— Dan Houghton (@DanHoughton_) January 1, 2020   Nice New Years start @LloydsBank ..

I have to pay the corporation tax and tax my car and cant be late, your failures are really poor— Ed Austin Proud European  #FBPE  (@EdAustin11) January 1, 2020  A number of UK banks have experienced outages in recent months. NatWests online and mobile phone app crashed on Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year. By far the worst meltdown was at TSB last year, caused by the change to a new IT platform before it had been fully tested. It resulted in almost 1.9 million customers being locked out of their accounts and the problems took months to fully resolve. In October, MPs warned that IT failures in the banking sector were running at an unacceptable rate. The Treasury select committee said customers were being left cashless and cut off after problems at several financial groups, adding: The current level and frequency of disruption and consumer harm is unacceptable. With bank branches and cash machines disappearing, customers are increasingly reliant on online banking services, but these have been severely disrupted by IT failures at firms including TSB, Visa, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, the committee said.","537"
"2020-01-01T17:35:14Z","commentisfree","Opinion","The Guardian view on internet censorship: when access is denied","For a long time, the seductive promise of the internet was of expanding horizons. Individual users would reach out, discovering new friends and new prospects. Nation would speak unto nation. That dream was not unfounded, but it was always an incomplete account, and the sceptics are increasingly being proved right. We are entering an age when what defines the internet may be not expansion but contraction; while the number of its users continues to grow, the imaginative and discursive space it offers is under threat. That space is constrained not only by tech firms decisions and customers choices, but by the diktat of governments. Look to a new record set by India at the end of the year. In mid-December, the internet shutdown in Kashmir  one of several in the country  became the longest ever imposed in a democracy. The government celebrated with restrictions in Delhi, too. Indias actions put it in bad but plentiful company. The year began with a 20-day shutdown in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sudan, Zimbabwe and Iraq are among those who followed due to protests. (Ethiopia cut off access for fear of cheating in exams, as well as following the assassinations of officials.) The effect was not only to prevent information coming in, or circulating internally, but to hinder news getting out. Access Now, an advocacy group dedicated to a free and open internet, says that shutdowns  sometimes targeting specific services, or throttling bandwidth rather than totally closing down access  leapt from 75 in 2016 to 196 in 2018. Last years tally, still being finalised, will show another rise. Spreading controlsShutdowns are the most blunt and conspicuous aspect of internet restrictions. Other methods range from fake news laws in Singapore and Myanmar to the blocking of particular platforms. The US NGO Freedom House has recorded declines in net freedom eight years in a row. In part, of course, censorship is rising because internet use is increasing. More than half the world is now online. Communities have found new sources of information and opinion, and a new way to magnify their voices. Some of the governments spending billions to get their peoples online are simultaneously finding ways to deny them access. The global tilt towards authoritarianism is another critical factor, and has helped drive demand for sophisticated censorship technologies. Leaders seeking to expand their traditional information controls (arresting journalists; closing printing presses) into the new realm are also taking cues from each other; when Benin shut down access last year, it followed the regional examples of Togo and the Gambia. No country has done more to encourage the spread of internet restrictions than China, which has developed the worlds most sophisticated and wide-reaching censorship system, comprising internal controls, the Great Firewall blocking external services and, say researchers, the Great Cannon, a tool for DDoS attacks that overwhelm their targets with traffic. Though Beijing, too, has used shutdowns, for the most part it has ensured that it does not need to do so. Five years ago, Iran announced that China would help to develop its national information network and ensure safe and healthy domestic services. In November, during widespread protests, it managed to cut users off from the global internet while internal networks functioned relatively normally. Russia announced last month that it had completed tests to check that its internet services would work if the country were cut off from the world wide web. It follows a sovereign internet bill which substantially increases the governments control, stating that all internal traffic should be carried within the countrys own networks, with other traffic going through registered exchange points. There are economic benefits to persuading other countries to buy censorship technologies, as there are in making it hard or impossible for users to access foreign services, pushing them towards domestic rivals. But this is not just a commercial endeavour. Xi Jinping wants to transform China into a cyber superpower, touting the countrys regime as a new option for other countries and nations that want to speed up their development while preserving their independence. China is exporting not only its technology but its laws and skills, normalising its censorship practices. It has invited dozens of countries to seminars on legislation and policy. Freedom House has noted that soon after officials took such training, Vietnam introduced a cybersecurity law mimicking Chinas own. Testing the limitsTellingly, the Chinese state-run Peoples Daily Online welcomed Indias internet shutdown in Assam and Meghalaya last month. A commentary on the website suggested that this had once again proved that the necessary regulation of the internet is a reasonable choice of sovereign countries based on national interests, and a natural extension of national sovereignty in cyberspace. Its true that democracies  even those far more liberal than Narendra Modis India  set limits upon what can be published, sometimes wrongly. But they tend to restrict far less material than autocracies, and the distinction is qualitative too. There is an obvious difference between banning images of child sexual abuse, and barring any criticism of political leaders. There is also a profound difference between a clear and transparent set of specific rules which can be challenged in independent courts and changed by a democratically elected legislature, and vague injunctions applied arbitrarily and behind a veil. In China, censorship decisions are themselves secret. The most challenging issue may be how to respond when services are used to incite hatred and violence. Myanmar, Bangladesh, India and other places have experienced the deadly real-world effects of lies spreading at previously unimaginable speed online. Yet each claim that restrictions are needed to protect the public must be scrutinised; unscrupulous governments too often abuse them. Even in immediate crises, closing off services can leave potential victims vulnerable and the information vacuum can magnify distrust. A better way forward is regulation which obliges tech companies to live up to their responsibilities. Introducing friction may be appropriate where prohibition is not. WhatsApp limited how many times a message can be forwarded after the viral spread of false rumours about child abduction led to lynchings in India. Where internet restrictions are needed, they must be both proportionate and transparent. Information matters. If it didnt, autocrats would not be so anxious to control its flow. And the people they rule would not keep finding ways to circumvent those restrictions.","1051"
"2020-01-01T17:23:01Z","world","World news","Calls for tourism boycott add to pressure to reopen Cyprus trial","Pressure is mounting on the Cypriot authorities to reassess the case of a British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped as anger rises over the verdict. Calls for a tourism boycott of the country were backed by the womans mother, who said Ayia Napa, the holiday resort in which her 19-year-old daughter said the attack took place, was unsafe. If you go and report something thats happened to you, youre either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like whats happened to my daughter may happen, she told the BBC. The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room on 17 July. But after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later, she was charged and a dozen men aged between 15 and 22 who had been arrested over the incident freed. Her mother said the woman, who had been due to begin university in September, was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations and sleeping for up to 20 hours a day as a result of the condition hypersomnia. During a five-month trial, the Briton claimed she had been forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police, telling the judge she was scared for my life. On Monday, she was ruled by a judge to have wilfully indulged in public mischief. The teenager, who spent a month in Nicosia general prison before being bailed at the end of August, has been prevented from leaving Cyprus since July. She could face up to a year in prison and a 1,700 (1,500) fine when she is sentenced on 7 January. Within hours of the court decision being announced, calls for a boycott appeared on social media. The storm erupted as Britains Foreign Office, in a highly unusual step, also raised serious concerns over the woman receiving a fair trial. On Monday judge Michalis Papathanasiou, sitting in Famagustas district court, pronounced that prosecutors had proved her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.   Related: Timeline: the British teenager convicted over rape claims in Cyprus   The verdict has also put the government of President Nicos Anastasiades on the defensive. As one of the regions most popular destinations, with an economy greatly dependent on the tourist industry, calls for a boycott have taken the affair to another level. UK tourists top the league tables of arrivals, and Politis, a leading daily, described the Mediterranean country as being up against the wall. But while the government spokesman, Kyriakos Kousios, expressed sympathy for the Britons mother, he also described public reaction to the case as exaggerated. I can understand the mother because she is the mother and I would expect any mother to do anything possible to help her daughter or son, he told the Guardian. But we are not happy with the extent of publicity and the reaction, which has been exaggerated. We would have wished that these [boycott] calls hadnt happened. The island nations court system, like its judiciary, was entirely independent of the state mechanism, the spokesman insisted. As a former crown colony, Cypruss legal system is based on British law. As a government we cannot, under any circumstances, intervene in a pending case before the court, he said, repeating that court proceedings were initiated only after the student retracted her original complaint. What would happen if a Cypriot was brought before a court in the UK? Would the government intervene and would the Cypriots campaign to boycott England? he asked. Her lawyers have argued that, in contravention of EU community law, a statement retracting the rape claim was signed by the teenager with no lawyer present and after eight hours of police interrogation that was neither videoed nor recorded. Determined to clear her name, they have vowed to take the case to Cypruss supreme court and, if necessary, the European court of human rights. On Monday Papathanasiou argued that, motivated by anger, the teenager had falsely levelled the rape claim against the Israelis, when she realised video clips of her having consensual sex with one of them had been recorded by others in the group on their mobile phones. Her testimony before the court had been evasive and contradictory, he said. Protesters, led by women activists, have deplored the judgment, calling it the product of a system that remains insensitive to gender and rape. As condemnation of the verdict spreads, so does internal dissent over the way the case has been handled. On Tuesday a former attorney general, Alekos Markides, added to the criticism, saying the matter should have been wrapped up long ago instead of assuming such international proportions. It should have ended with the one-month prison sentence and not assumed such dimensions, he told a local radio station. As an offence, causing public mischief was among the lightest on the statute books, he said. Blaming the international outcry on the courts obstinacy, he also criticised the legal system for targeting a 19-year-old tourist who we have kept in Cyprus for five months now, a  girl who has a clean criminal record  who we have forced to collect donations to cover her legal costs and have forbidden from travelling to her country. This rigidity of the court has provoked reaction internationally.","867"
"2020-01-01T17:13:28Z","football","Football","Deulofeu and Doucouré deliver victory for 10-man Watford over Wolves","Nigel Pearson is surprised at how much he is enjoying life back in the Premier League. Watford, too, are revelling in his return as the manager has transformed their fortunes since his arrival last month. Six points adrift at the bottom when he was appointed, they are now within touching distance of safety thanks to this hard-fought win over Wolves that took their tally from the last four matches to 10 points. Normally teams in trouble fall apart when things go against them but Watford are doing the opposite, with this game being the second in a row they have won despite being reduced to 10 men. Christian Kabasele had a yellow card upgraded to a red with more than 20 minutes left but Watford fended off Wolves, who could not add to Pedro Netos goal. The ones scored by Gerard Deulofeu and Abdoulaye Doucour were enough to fuel increasingly realistic hopes of a successful rescue mission by Pearson. Im surprised Im enjoying it as much as I am because, quite frankly, in my own mind I was sort of semi-retired [before Watford asked him to replace Quique Sanchez Flores three weeks ago], Pearson said. I was not really looking to get back into work. But now Im back working Im enjoying the challenge. I know we still have an awful lot of hard work to do but both [coach] Craig [Shakespeare] and myself have come into it and just said lets give everything we can to it and see where it takes us.   Related: Southamptons Danny Ings sinks Tottenham and Harry Kane limps off   There is a lot of hard work to be done and it would be foolish to think the job is over  its far from over  but weve given ourselves more of a chance by getting back in contact with the pack. Troy Deeney attributes Watfords improvement to the no BS culture that Pearson has fostered, explaining the managers high standards have inspired everyone at Vicarage Road. Wolves, mind you, made the better start and should have taken the lead. First, Ben Foster made a fine save to thwart Matt Doherty after an excellent pass from deep by Conor Coady. Then Doherty supplied a precise diagonal pass to Ral Jimnez, who took the ball down on his chest before steering a shot way off target from 15 yards. Wolves felt wronged in the 22nd minute when Neto was booked for simulation after beating Craig Dawson to the ball and tumbling in the box over the defenders outstretched leg. There was contact but not, according to the referee and VAR, enough to justify the defenders fall. Then Watford began to assert themselves, especially through Deulofeu. In the 29th minute he wriggled into the box before feeding Ismaila Sarr, who forced a solid save from Rui Patrcio from 12 yards. But the goalkeeper was beaten one minute later after a mistake by Leander Dendoncker, who gave the ball away to Sarr. The forward helped it on to Deulofeu, who fired into the far corner of the net. Watford nearly extended their lead from a simple throw-in, with Deeney flicking on Dawsons delivery to Deulofeu, who skewed his shot over from close range.   Related: Manchester City v Everton: Premier League  live!   As with the first, Watfords second goal, four minutes into the second half, originated in unusually loose play by Wolves, with Jimnez gifting away possession in midfield. Deulofeu skittered towards the area and fed Doucour, who struck his shot well but needed a deflection off Coady to beat the goalkeeper. Neto gave Wolves fresh hope. The 19-year-old, who was so distraught to have a goal disallowed by VAR at Anfield on Sunday enjoyed good fortune this time as his shot from 20 yards took a nick off Kabasele and flew over Foster into the net. Neto was replaced by Diogo Jota, whose first involvement was to be pulled down at the edge of the area by Kabasele. The referee, Andrew Madley, showed the defender a yellow card but VAR advised him to change it to a red on the grounds that Jota would have had an obvious scoring chance if not for the foul. We were hanging on a little bit but the desire of the players to keep the ball out of the net and put their bodies on the line was clear for everybody to see, Pearson said. That bodes well.","716"
"2020-01-01T17:11:05Z","stage","Stage","Annie Wigzell obituary","My mother, Annie Wigzell, who has died aged 94, was a casting director at the National Theatre from its early days at the Old Vic with its first director, Laurence Olivier, and then with Peter Hall at its new home on the South Bank. She worked on many significant productions, including the Nationals first world premiere, The Royal Hunt of the Sun, Miss Julie with Albert Finney and Maggie Smith, and Jumpers with Michael Hordern and Diana Rigg. Born in London, Annie was the only daughter of Arthur Robinson, a captain in the Royal Army Service Corps, who served for many years in India, and his wife, Grace (nee Hignett). Grace returned to Britain from India for the birth of her daughter and then went back soon afterwards, meaning that until the age of four Annie was brought up by her grandmother. Her parents separated soon after they returned from India and Annie was sent first to a boarding school in Broadstairs, Kent, then to a convent school near Wantage, Oxfordshire. At 17 she went to London to study acting at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. During the second world war she joined Ensa, the Entertainments National Service Association, and was sent to Egypt to entertain the troops. She returned to Britain in 1947 and worked for the HM Tennent theatrical production company. It was while she was assistant stage manager on the White Carnation at the Globe theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue that she met my father, the actor Peter Wigzell. They married in 1953 (although she continued to use her maiden name, Annie Robinson, for work) and I was born the following year. A couple of years later a chance meeting with Antony Armstrong-Jones (later Lord Snowdon), who had come to photograph the play she was working on, led to a brief break from the theatre world. He was looking for a part-time secretary and offered her the job. She worked at his studio for almost three years until he married Princess Margaret. Annie returned to the theatre when the National was founded in 1963, initially joining the small team at the Old Vic to deal with the mail from aspiring actors and to arrange auditions. She ended up becoming a casting director, with much of her time spent talent spotting in repertory theatre productions across the country. Actors she brought to the National included Michael Kitchen, Brenda Blethyn, Tim Pigott-Smith and Colin Firth. When Hall was appointed director of the National in succession to Olivier in 1974, Annie formed a close working relationship with the new casting director, Gillian Diamond. They became a well-known double act at the centre of British theatre for 10 years, their office overlooking the Thames a haven for stressed actors seeking tea and sympathy. They remained close friends long after Annie retired in 1985 and until Gillians death in 2015. After Annies retirement, she and my father left London and moved into an old farmhouse near Frome, in Somerset, where they lived for more than 30 years. Peter died in 2001. Annie is survived by me and her grandsons, Tom and Jack.","521"

The Peoples Bank of China is allowing commercial banks to hold less capital in reserve, freeing up about 800bn yuan (87bn) in new funds for loans. It will cut Chinas banks reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points, to 12.5%, from 6 January. The move means lenders can lend more of their savers funds to borrowers to support the economy, rather than keeping it on hand. The RRR was cut three times during 2019 as Beijing tried to protect companies from the damage caused by the US-China trade war. Despite these efforts, growth hit a 30-year low in 2019, with manufacturing activity shrinking for much of the year. The PBoC said this latest cut was meant to further support the development of the real economy and lower real financing costs.   Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The lower RRR could also prevent financial conditions tightening in the run-up to the lunar new year this month, when firms and families need cash on hand.

Facing potential [unpredictable and high-impact] black swan and [highly probable] grey rhino incidents in the financial market, we had the resolution, confidence and ability to win the battle of forestalling and defusing major financial risks, Yi declared.","245"

Ill tell you who would get my vote, even though he wont win it in a million years, Graham Potter at Brighton. Having just watched the Seagulls hold Frank Lampards Chelsea (another contender) to a draw through shrewd substitutions and tactics Im not so sure that theres a better manager in the league, showponies included. You?  Well, Klopp would be 1st, 2nd and 3rd, but aside from him Id go for Chris Wilder. I do like Potter a lot, though.     3.07pm GMT   6 min Leicester have started very impressively, their swagger apparently not affected by those defeats against Manchester City and Liverpool.     3.05pm GMT   3 min Maddison plays a lovely pass inside the full-back for Ricardo, who wins a corner. Leicester are playing a back three, not the usual 4-1-4-1. One of those three centre-halves, Jonny Evans, almost scores from the corner. Maddison curled it towards the near post, where Evans firm header was palmed up in the air by Dubravka. It came back to Evans, who tried to loop a follow-up header into the far corner. Dubravka reached over a couple of players to flap the ball down, and one of the Newcastle defenders belted it clear.     3.00pm GMT   1 min Peep peep!

Referee Martin Atkinson  Updated at 3.07pm GMT    9.50am GMT  Preamble  Hello and welcome to live coverage of Newcastle v Leicester from St James Park. Newcastle have come a long way since the return fixture in September, when they were humiliated 5-0. Steve Bruce, the subject of disgraceful ridicule around that time, turned things round impressively, and his side found a nice comfortable spot in mid-table. Things are slightly less cosy after three defeats in four, and with a grim injury list that is getting longer rather than shorter. Newcastle are 11th, six points clear of the relegation places, but they have some tricky fixtures coming up and will want to avoid going on the kind of run that can turn mid-table security into a desperate fight for survival. Still, when they skulked away from the King Power Stadium in September, they would have taken this position. Kick off is at 3pm.   Updated at 2.00pm GMT ","2132"
"2020-01-01T17:04:45Z","football","Football","Leicester strengthen grip on second as Maddison sparks win over Newcastle","History finds myriad ways to repeat itself but Steve Bruce could have done without the latest example coming at Newcastles expense as his players limped  literally and metaphorically  into a new decade. On an afternoon which bolstered Leicesters (albeit somewhat slender) hopes of securing a second Premier League title in four years, Brendan Rodgerss side comprehensively outplayed a 10-man Tyneside ensemble for the second time this season.   Related: Southamptons Danny Ings sinks Tottenham and Harry Kane limps off   In September in the east Midlands, the score was 5-0 and Leicester signalled their status as serious Champions League contenders. On that occasion Isaac Haydens dismissal left Bruces team a man short; this time, an injury to Fabian Schr shortly after halftime, and with all three home substitutes already used, virtually rubberstamped Rodgerss latest victory. It needs stressing that, well before fortune started frowning on Newcastle, James Maddisons excellence had already indicated Leicester would cement their grip on second place. Maddison was outstanding in midfield, at times making even the 10-point chasm between his side and Liverpool seem surmountable. We played very well, Rodgers said. We want to finish as high as possible. The potential excites me. The sharpness of Maddisons passing and movement in front of a revamped visiting back five not only ensured the injured Jamie Vardy was barely missed but helped his teammates to shred Bruces gameplan. Indeed with Leicester sometimes enjoying 80% possession, the only mild surprise was that it took the impressive Ayoze Prez  sold by Newcastle in exchange for 30m last summer  36 minutes to open the scoring. By way of exacerbating Geordie gloom, his goal originated with Florian Lejeunes horribly underhit pass being intercepted by the Spaniard. All that remained was for Prez to cleverly dodge Schrs lunging attentions and direct a rightfoot shot into the far corner. Poor Lejeune had little chance to compose himself before making another awful mistake. This time his appalling clearance was intercepted by Ricardo Pereira, prefacing Maddisons goal. After shifting the ball on to his left foot, Maddison unleashed a drive which, in whizzing inexorably into the top corner, simultaneously sent defiant messages to Liverpool and Manchester City and destroyed any remnants of new year optimism still lurking on the Gallowgate End.    Fabian Schrs injury meant that Newcastle played much of the second half with only 10 men. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images   Bruces scope for tactical adjustment was negated by the late first-half hamstring and groin injuries to Jetro Willems, Javier Manquillo and Jonjo Shelvey which necessitated their swift replacement by DeAndre Yedlin, Emil Krafth and Sean Longstaff. With all three substitutes on and the second half barely under way Schr then pulled up with another hamstring pull, promptly hobbling off. Deja vu descended. Once again Newcastle were down to 10 men and struggling badly against a Leicester side who, by way of variation, slowed the pace to exhibition level before the substitute Hamza Choudhury scored his first senior goal. Choudhurys dangerous tackle during Leicesters League Cup win here in August left Newcastles much missed Matt Ritchie requiring two ankle operations and his every touch was duly booed. Not that the vitriol raining down from the stands prevented Choudhury meeting Wilfred Ndidis pass and unleashing a rising shot which consigned Bruces side to a third successive defeat. Ive never known four players injured within 15 minutes, the Newcastle manager said. Its bizarre. To play so many games over Christmas is ridiculous and this is the consequence. But Leicester are very good.","551"
"2020-01-01T17:01:30Z","football","Football","Southampton’s Danny Ings sinks Tottenham and Harry Kane limps off","Just when a disappointing afternoon for Tottenham ostensibly could not get any worse, Harry Kane limped off down the tunnel 15 minutes from time clutching his left hamstring, with Spurs succumbing to the fourth league defeat of Jos Mourinhos reign after another powder-puff performance. It was at that point Mourinho, irked by his sides flimsy display and Kane joining the 55m record signing Tanguy Ndombele in prematurely trudging down the tunnel, decided to take matters into his own hands, wandering over to the Southampton dugout to insult the goalkeeping coach, Andrew Sparkes  an act of petulance that earned him a booking from the referee, Mike Dean.   Related: Jos Mourinho calls Southampton coach an idiot and attacks VAR power   In some ways Mourinho was only just warming up, later accusing the Southampton ballboys of timewasting before sticking the boot into Ndombele for being injury prone after the midfielder was forced off midway through the first half. Mourinhos six-minute post-match press conference was box office but the Portugueses personal attack on a member of Ralph Hasenhttls backroom staff stunk of deflecting from another abysmal away performance, a second defeat on the road in four matches. For Southampton this was the latest episode to cherish across a brilliant Christmas period, with victory here lifting them towards mid-table after a return of 10 points from a possible 12. Familiar flaws marred Tottenhams first outing of the new year, with Danny Ings fooling Toby Alderweireld to continue his extraordinary form in front of goal. It made painful viewing for Mourinho, who reacted to being booked by apologetically patting Deans torso, powerless as another side pierced holes in a frail defence that has kept one clean sheet since he took charge in November. Under Mourinho, Spurs have lost four of their nine league matches and, after stuttering to a draw at Norwich last weekend, this was a meagre retort. Take nothing away from Southampton  Ings took his goal superbly  but Spurs were carved open too easily. Jack Stephens played a simple ball over the top and Ings allowed it to bounce before nonchalantly flicking it inside Alderweireld with his right foot and instinctively stroking home beyond Paulo Gazzaniga with his left. Gazzaniga was beaten and Alderweireld humiliated, with the former Southampton defender skidding away on the turf on all fours as Ings lashed in his ninth goal in as many league starts, taking his tally to 13 for the season. Tottenham surrendered possession cheaply in the first place, with Ryan Sessegnons panicked pass from leftback landing at Stephenss feet. To make things worse, Ndombele was clipped by Stuart Armstrong in the buildup to the goal, leading to Giovani Lo Celso replacing the Frenchman, who has struggled for match fitness since signing from Lyon. Stephenss ball downfield was simple but Ings showed wonderful composure to finish.    Danny Ings clips the ball over Toby Alderweireld before scoring Southamptons winner against Tottenham. Photograph: Ian Walton/Reuters   Its unbelievable at the moment, Hasenhttl said. If he has a chance, he scores. He is full of self-confidence. Tottenhams resistance was feeble and Southampton would have doubled their lead but for a crucial interception by Alderweireld after Nathan Redmond latched on to Armstrongs low cross from the right. That move in itself typified and exuded everything a lacklustre Tottenham side seemed to be missing, with Armstrong doing brilliantly to juggle and keep the ball in on the touchline before supplying Redmond with an inviting cross. Armstrongs work-rate was relentless but it was another mightily convincing team performance, a world away from that 9-0 defeat here in October. A really fantastic start to this year, Hasenhttl said. Maybe the best performance at home this season so far. We were so aggressive, so committed against the ball and it was very, very difficult to create chances against us. Spurs lacked rhythm and seemed disjointed from back to front. Hasenhttls side kept them at arms length throughout and the only whiff of Alex McCarthys goal came when Kane swept home a Christian Eriksen free-kick, only for the assistant referee to raise his flag. Tottenhams celebrations were quickly curtailed and Kanes match was soon over, with the striker injuring himself as he took aim inside the box.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  In the first half Southampton also survived a VAR check when Alex McCarthy clashed with Dele Alli after scrambling Kanes powerful shot to safety. From the resulting corner Jan Vertonghen scooped over unmarked and, four minutes from time, Lucas Mouras effort went out for a corner after smacking Ryan Bertrand on what proved a thoroughly miserable day all around for Tottenham.","732"
"2020-01-01T17:00:09Z","football","Football","The post-Sam Kerr reality is proving a harsh one for Perth Glory","Since touching down in London earlier this week and joining her first training sessions with Chelsea, Sam Kerr has been all over her new clubs social media channels. Shes expected to make her debut this weekend, as the Champions League-chasing Blues play Reading, in a moment to be monitored closely by Australias football communities and the rest of the world. Theres no denying that the W-League misses Kerr, and is probably viewing her new adventures with a tinge of both pride in what shes achieving and a degree of Fomo because shes not here anymore. But none miss her more than her hometown club, Perth Glory.   Related: Sam Kerr the best in the world? Tell us something we don't know | Samantha Lewis   How have they fared since her departure? Not great, is the answer in short. The answer in detail is somewhat bleaker: to date the Glory have scored a paltry four goals in six games, and sit second to bottom of the W-League with a single point. Last season Perth acquired their first point in their first game, and it took them just under two game to net their first four goals. By the beginning of round eight last season theyd scored 17 goals, had ten points, and were unbeaten. After round eight last season Perth were top, and remained in the top four for the rest of the season. And, of course, they went on to make the grand final, losing to Sydney FC. Its not unexpected for teams to experience a dip when their star player moves on, especially when that player was to the team what Kerr was for Perth: the fulcrum of their attack whether shes the goalscorer or creator, or otherwise enabling her teammates to perform at their best as she led by example as captain. But Perths slide this season has been something else. Most striking with the departure of Kerr, as well as 2018-19 teammates Nikki Stanton and Rachel Hill, all architects of Perth Glorys success last season, has been the relinquishing of their swashbuckling on-pitch panache. If youre going to draw a game, after all, why 1-1 when it could be 4-4? The situation, then, leaves much to be desired on the part of the decision makers at the club, who clearly werent prepared for the post-Kerr era. Given her departure was signalled long before the 2019-20 season kicked off, there should have been sufficient impetus for recruitment plans to be put in place that befit the clubs status of league finalists.   Related: Sam Kerrs watershed move and the start of the new normal for women's football | Samantha Lewis   But Perth were slow to announce player signings in the pre-season, and even allowing for the fact that only Sam Kerr is Sam Kerr, there was no big name to replace her. As other W-League clubs were quick to snap up her Matildas teammates returning down under, Perth did not follow suit. And the FFA marquee player fund, which can be used by any club for the appropriate player, has been unused this season. Keeping Kerr in the W-League last season, when Chelsea were already reported to be inquiring about the possibility of her services, through the marquee player mechanism was a no-brainer. It reiterated the esteem in which shes already held in Australian football, while the rest of the world cottoned on to her brilliance. And what better way to instigate the concept to the league than via a player who is well on the way to becoming an all-time great of the game. Then FFA chief executive David Gallop made it clear when Kerr was announced as the leagues first marquee player that part of the importance lay in the scope for raising the leagues profile. We truly hope that historic days like today will ensure we create an important legacy for professional female players in the future, he said at the time. Such rhetoric is appropriate for the W-League which, in global womens footballs increasingly crowded marketplace, needs to assert its points of difference and what it can offer players. The prestige and pay associated with a marquee player contract is one of these. Geared towards building audiences for the last W-League season before the World Cup, the marquee player concept at the time hoped to represent a new watershed moment for the Matildas and Australian football, and possibly attract other new international players in the future. Which for the W-League arguably has worked - the standard continues to rise, and think of the calibre of the NC Courage cohort at Western Sydney Wanderers is a testament to the leagues international appeal. But bound in this is the fact the W-League has found a way to go on in the post-Kerr era in a way that, right now, seems to have passed Perth Glory by. As the first W-League club to boast a marquee player, they havent used this to their advantage as they could have. Legacy is a nice word, after all, and is often thrown around in football. But a legacy, as it can be viewed at this particular point in time, in which a team is left to crumble after the marquee player moves on, surely isnt what anyone had in mind. After all, what real benefit can come from pitching a marquee on foundations which might prove to be made of sand? When the eventual winds of change banish not just the tent but its anchors, too? As Perth Glory are finding this season, not a lot when youre kissing the prospect of finals football goodbye.","898"

Police detained about 400 people on charges including illegal assembly and possession of offensive weapons after the rally on Wednesday, which organisers said was attended by more than a million people. It was one of the largest numbers of arrests in a single day since the unrest began.    Riot police detain protesters. Photograph: Vivek Prakash/EPA   But the march had begun in a mood of carnival celebration  there were protesters in costumes and families with children and elderly people. Marchers chanted slogans including Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our era. Riot police fired teargas rounds in Wan Chai district after protesters threw objects at officers who had arrested several people for allegedly vandalising a bank. Some protesters retaliated by throwing molotov cocktails at the police, but many in the crowd were caught by surprise as the march was expected to be peaceful and most did not wear protective gear. Police demanded that the protest organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, immediately call off the demonstration, but large crowds continued to march and police declared that they were taking part in an illegal assembly. As night fell, police used water cannon on crowds in Wan Chai and the financial district of Central. Protesters laid bricks across the main thoroughfare in Central in an attempt to impede the polices advance towards the area.    Hundreds of thousands joined the march. Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP   A police statement said protesters had blocked roads with barricades, dug up bricks from pavements and set fires to banks and cash machines. At a late-night press briefing, Senior Supt Ng Lok Chun blamed radical protesters for hijacking and disrupting the march and said police had fired teargas because they were surrounded by protesters who were throwing objects at them. There had already been a bleak start to 2020: shortly after revellers counted down to midnight and shouted Happy new year!, police in the central district of Mong Kok shot teargas at protesters who set off fireworks and set fire to roadblocks. On Tuesday night police deployed water cannon to disperse protesters while armoured vehicles cleared roadblocks. The crowd had gathered outside a metro station where people were leaving flowers to commemorate protesters rumoured to have died during a clash with police four months ago. The government denies that the deaths occurred. The anti-government movement in Hong Kong, sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent to China for trial, is showing no signs of abating. Protesters say they will not give up unless the government meets their demands, which include universal suffrage and an independent investigation into police brutality.   Related: Children of the revolution: the Hong Kong youths ready to 'sacrifice everything'   As of last week, 6,494 people had been arrested since the movement started in June, some as young as 12, according to the police. Many in Hong Kong, including pro-democracy supporters, are weary of the frequent violent confrontations in the movement and are seeking new directions in their attempt to press the government into conceding to their demands.    Protesters try to dodge teargas. Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters   Some are urging fellow Hong Kongers on social media to use economic means to put pressure on the government instead, including joining trade unions so that they can launch strikes and other collective actions more effectively. We want to show our determination to the world that we will not back down on our resistance against an authoritarian regime, said Mary Chin, a former bank employee in her 40s. The Civil Human Rights Front condemned the polices abrupt revocation of its permission for the march, which it estimated was attended by a million people. The government has shown its unwillingness to listen to the voices of the mass and it has infringed on their right to assembly, it said in a statement. Hong Kongers shall not back down and peace shall not resume with the ongoing police brutality. In his new year address, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, acknowledged that the situation in Hong Kong has been everybodys concern over the past few months as he called for a harmonious and stable environment for Hong Kong. Sounding relatively conciliatory compared with earlier, more threatening remarks, Xi said in the televised address: Hong Kongs prosperity and stability is the wish of Hong Kong compatriots and the expectation for the people of the motherland.","717"

Related: The decade that shook America   In his annual report on the state of the judiciary, the George W Bush-appointee, who will preside over Donald Trumps impeachment trial in the Senate, said civic education had fallen by the wayside. In our age, he wrote, when social media can instantly spread rumour and false information on a grand scale, the publics need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital. Roberts did not mention Trump but his statement was widely interpreted as part of an ongoing effort to shield the judicial branch from executive harassment. The president and the chief justice have clashed before. In November 2018, Roberts issued a striking rebuke over the presidents criticism of a judge who blocked an asylum order. We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges, Roberts said. Trump dismissed Roberts comments, and blamed the judges for bedlam and chaos. Roberts, appointed by a Republican, is by any measure a conservative but he has emerged as something of a swing vote on a supreme court tilted right under Trump. In his 2019 report, he said: We should celebrate our strong and independent judiciary, a key source of national unity and stability. He also urged his colleagues on the bench to reflect on our duty to judge without fear or favor, deciding each matter with humility, integrity and dispatch, and said we should each resolve to do our best to maintain the publics trust that we are faithfully discharging our solemn obligation to equal justice under law.

Garland, Roberts said, has spent two decades quietly volunteering at an elementary school. I am confident that many other federal judges, without fanfare or acclaim, are playing similar selfless roles throughout the country, Roberts wrote. The judiciary, he said, has an important role to play in civic education, and I am pleased to report that the judges and staff of our federal courts are taking up the challenge.","390"

Last month, the senator told the Guardian that the support Buttigieg was receiving from billionaires was exactly the problem with American politics. Buttigieg has opened fundraisers to the press and disclosed the identities of top donors. But he has also insisted Democrats need to fundraise from anyone, so they can remain competitive against Trump, who has amassed a formidable war chest.

"2020-01-01T16:26:08Z","commentisfree","Opinion","These are the questions Labour must answer if it is ever to win again","Nearly a month ago Jeremy Corbyn announced he would step down after a period of reflection. This week he offered the first fruits of that process: 2019, Corbyn announced, had been quite the year for our country and our labour movement. Nevertheless, he added: We have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson.
It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry. But Labour is unquestionably going to have to do very much better than this if it is to climb out of the electoral abyss into which Corbyn led it in December. Talking about resistance to Johnson is simply displacement activity. The central truth is that Labour has to make itself the electable alternative that it failed to be in 2019. It needs to have a strategy for power. In the real world, power is hope, not the other way round.







The plain truth that underpins everything about Labour today is that it lost, extremely badly. Its share of the poll, 32%, was among the lowest in its history. Its seat total, 203, is its lowest since 1935. Labour is now less than ever a national UK party, with only one MP in Scotland, only six in England south of the M4 outside London and Bristol, and swaths of losses in parts of the north and Midlands. Judging by Michael Ashcrofts election day poll, its core vote is probably closer to 20%.
And it could easily have been even worse. If the Brexit party had stood down in Labour seats, the losses would have been larger. Labours vote was also boosted by the absence of a strong Liberal Democrat challenge. This is why it is misleading to claim that 2019 was not as awful as 1983, when there was a very formidable Liberal-SDP challenge. Nevertheless, Labours 32% means it is still the second party in British politics. That is a powerful base for a recovery if it takes wise decisions. But it could easily evaporate if it takes foolish ones.
This is extremely likely to occur if Labour continues to put the cart before the horse. The leadership election is under way. But the period of reflection has barely started. It needs more time and structure. The costs were obvious this week, when the apparent frontrunner published a manifesto of vacuous generality, which posed no difficult questions and lacked substantive proposals for doing anything differently. On the basis of that article, if Rebecca Long-Bailey is the answer, then Labour is asking the wrong question.
If it is to be useful, Labours period of reflection needs some ground rules it currently lacks. These include: a recognition of the gravity of the situation, an obligation to answer difficult questions, a dispassionate study of the facts, an open-minded approach, a willingness to admit mistakes, the avoidance of slogans, and the willingness to listen to others  who should include Labours opponents and (increasingly the same thing) the voters. There is not much sign of any of that yet.
The right questions need to be rooted in a balanced and honest appraisal of Labours electoral position. And the answers must avoid the habit, which affects all sides in the party, of evading difficult truths by talking about something else. So here are some of the important questions, and my own brief and provisional answers:
Was Brexit the main problem? It was one of them, but Labours Brexit problem was its longstanding ambiguity, not its pro-European approach. Labour still needs a European policy for the post-Brexit 2020s.
So was it Corbyn? The surveys say yes. His ratings were the worst ever for a Labour leader. But the Corbyn programme was not believed either. Competence matters, and Labour had not put in the hard yards on that. Corbyn would have claimed the credit for a win, so he must accept the blame for the defeat.
Did Labour win the argument? No, it did not. Some aspects of Labours campaign cut through, but not by enough. The election result tells the story: Labour lost. To say otherwise is to be in denial. Too many still are.
Was it the medias fault? No  but. Britains media is politically biased and not as good as it thinks it is. It made mistakes in 2019, some of which would have been difficult to avoid. But these get exaggerated. The answer is not a more politicised media but better standards.

 Related: The only way Labour can win is by ditching Labourism | Jeremy Gilbert 

Would a return to New Labour be the answer? Of course not  2024 will not be 1994. New Labour must own its failures, just as the Corbynistas must own theirs. But if Labour cannot reconcile its militants and its moderates, it will pay the price. It needs to try.
Should Labour be a socialist party? A big question for some, but not the main one for most. It depends what you mean by socialism. Labour ignores aspiration and the desire to do well at its peril. Individualism and community are not incompatible. It also depends on how much it matters to you to win elections.
Is it all over for Labour? No. See above. But Labour has been on a losing streak for a decade. It is now steered by a clique that have run it close to catastrophe, and who should get the boot. After 1992, many asked if Labour could ever win again. It turned out that it could. But this time things could get worse before they get better, and Labour may not win an election for a decade.
Should Labour split into a left party and a centre-left party? Not if it hopes to win power in the next 20 years. The traditions need to recognise that each is legitimate.
Finally, stop obsessing about the left. Most people are not interested. Think instead about problems, programmes and priorities. And we members of the Amalgamated Union of Commentators, Columnists and Allied Pundits should stop talking about Labour as us. Those days are gone. We must watch what happens next and allow judgments time to settle. Millions of people who want a better government and a different kind of society dont see Labour as the answer, let alone as all-knowing and all-virtuous, for the simple reason that right now it is neither.

His stint as ambassador in Libya came at a time of crisis and lasted less than a year, as shortly after his appointment in 1984 he was charged with breaking off diplomatic relations following the murder of the police officer Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London. Our family was the public face of the scramble to leave Tripoli, while in the background diplomats hurriedly destroyed secret files and coding equipment. His post having become redundant, my father moved to the UK Mission to the United Nations in New York, and from 1985 to 1988 was ambassador to Luxembourg. After a period as the first director general of the Joint Directorate for Overseas Trade Services, from 1993 until his retirement in 1996 he was ambassador in Greece, where he boosted trade and cultural relations with the highly successful Britain in Greece festival. He was born in Wimbledon, south-west London, to George Miles, who worked for the London county council, and his wife, Olive (nee Clapham), who was the first woman to pass the bar finals in England (in 1921). After attending Ampleforth college in north Yorkshire he gained a degree in classics and oriental studies at Merton College, Oxford, and joined the diplomatic service in 1960, spending periods at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London before beginning his travels in the Middle East in 1964, when he was posted as second secretary to Amman in Jordan. He was private secretary to the British high commissioner in Aden from 1967 to 1970, helping to bring down the shutters on colonial rule, then was posted to Cyprus, returning to London after three years there. He became head of the FCOs near east and north African department in 1980 before being appointed ambassador to Libya. In retirement he held various posts in the business world, including as chairman of MEC International, a consultancy promoting business with the Middle East. He was also president of the Society for Libyan Studies, and from 2004 to 2019 was deputy chairman of the Libyan British Business Council. Dad was principled and honest to a fault, and was never swayed by power or pressure. After the trade minister Alan Clark was once chastised by Margaret Thatcher when someone reported him for undermining government policy on Europe, I was proud to read in Clarks diaries that it could only be that fucking ambassador in Luxembourg. In later life, Dads decades of unquestioning loyalty as a civil servant gave way to a wry, independent and increasingly vocal take on diplomacy. Incensed by Tony Blairs policy on Israel and Iraq, he organised a critical letter that was signed by 52 mandarins and created a huge public stir. For many years he wrote opinion pieces on international affairs and diplomacy for the Guardian. In 1968 he married Julia Weiner, a social worker. She survives him, along with their children, Joe, Hugh, Lucy and me, and 11 grandchildren.","515"

Steve Jobs once said about work that it was our lifes mission to do what you love, but for most of us it is the compromise of finding what you can put up with. So, if most of us are never exactly going to love work, what can we do to make it a little less awful? For starters, lets be honest about what work is like. According to the magazine Management Today, the average Briton spends 16 hours a week in meetings, hostage to the drone of people they vaguely recognise. This is why most of us have learned that to survive in the modern workplace we need to master the Im not listening, but want you to think I am nod, along with the subtle art of checking WhatsApp under a notebook. We have become adept at not revealing our inner thoughts for fear of judgment. We give a performative Yes! when our bosses declare: That was a good meeting. The workplace survey expert Gallup has reported that only 8% of people in the UK are actively engaged in their jobs. Twice as many of us are classified as being actively disengaged, taking our unhappiness out on our job and our colleagues. We may seem to be going along with things, but inside we are seething. But there are simple steps we can take to start rebalancing this relationship with our workplace. Researchers have found that even the most miserable job can be redeemed by taking back a little control. Focus on getting your MIT done When workplace experts study what makes a good day at work, the answers are common sense. We say we have had a satisfying time when we have made progress in something meaningful. For many of us, stranded in a vast, open-plan savannah, playing email Tetris, the idea of progress feels unobtainable. This may be because one of the biggest challenges for human brains is switching between activities. Various attempts to measure our attention have suggested that, when we switch tasks, it takes between eight and 20 minutes for our attention to focus fully again.This is where the author Dan Pink has a valuable tip. Pinks approach is to do one action, his MIT (most important thing), before he does anything else. This way, if the MIT takes up to an hour of concentration, he has made progress on something before the email onslaught begins. Go for a walking meeting Yes, this might be embarrassing to suggest  but if anyone laughs, point out that researchers say going for a walking meeting can be one of the easiest ways to revive your mojo. Researchers from Stanford University in California looked into whether walking could trigger creativity. The results were outstanding. Walking resulted in a significant uplift in creative thinking: 81% of participants saw their scores go up between sitting and walking. The average increase was 60%. Interestingly, walking needs to be used appropriately: it is a powerful way to liberate ideas, but it is not the most effective way to resolve complex logical puzzles. The researchers also found that the power of walking lingered after the walk. Taking a stroll before undertaking a creative task fostered a significant uplift compared with staying seated. Other research, from a paper published in 2012, said that going for a 50-minute walk in nature can have a strong effect on our ability to concentrate. Are your colleagues still sniggering? Just ignore them  safe in the knowledge that JK Rowling said night-time walks are the surest way to overcome writers block. Take a lunch break British workers are well versed in eating al desko, but taking a step away from our workstations for a proper recovery more than pays its way  and not just at work. Psychologists from Baylor University in Texas found a relationship between people skipping lunch breaks and feeling exhausted at the weekend. Despite this, many of us feel a silent pressure to work through lunch. But there is good evidence that stepping away from our desks improves our work, too. Our attention is measurably worse later in the day  a 2006 study of workers at a medical centre in North Carolina found that the likelihood of a medical error occurring was four times higher at 4pm than at 9am. Our afternoon selves, rendered dopey with tiredness, simply are not as effective  and taking a break is one of the best ways to get back some of our zing. Research at Harvard University found that giving schoolchildren five-minute breaks every hour improved their results over the course of a day, whereas a lack of breaks saw their results spiral downwards (with the biggest declines among the least able pupils). If you need more persuading, think about this: skipping an hours lunch over the course of a year is the equivalent of five weeks holiday. So, make plans to meet a friend or to go to the gym  it could improve your whole week. Stay off email in the evenings Researchers at Harvard found that workers were crushed by the daily burden of emails and the need to be contactable at all hours. The worst afflicted were management consultants, who often checked emails if they awoke to go to the loo in the night. Modest changes, such as taking one evening a week off email, were suggested. The management consultants couldnt quite bear this, so they devised a scheme where one person was always checking night-time emails, while the rest of their colleagues had the evening off. The participants were euphoric. The mere thought of having a night off email duty seemed to have a measurable impact on their stress levels. Bruce Daisley is the European vice-president of Twitter.

"2020-01-01T15:49:28Z","technology","Technology","Google says it will no longer use 'Double Irish, Dutch sandwich' tax loophole","International tax authorities were welcoming in the new year after Googles parent company, Alphabet, announced it will no longer use a notorious tax loophole known as the Double Irish, Dutch sandwich. The technique allowed the tech giant to delay paying US taxes on international earnings for years, and pay a lower tax rate overseas. It is thought to have allowed American companies to cut their tax bills by hundreds of billions of dollars, but is finally being closed by authorities. A Google spokesman confirmed the company would scrap the intellectual property licensing structure, by which international profits are channelled through Ireland and on to Caribbean tax havens, putting them outside the reach of US tax authorities. This will simplify Googles tax arrangements in line with efforts by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to limit international tax avoidance, following changes to US and Irish tax law. It is estimated that by the end of 2017, some of Americas most profitable companies, including Apple, the largest by market capitalisation, had sequestered more than $1tn offshore, using the double Irish to park billions in ghost companies. Companies including Google, Cisco, Pfizer, Merck, Coca-Cola and Facebook all avoided a 35% US corporate tax rate, which has now been cut by Donald Trump. Like other multinationals that make use of tax minimization schemes, Google has always said it pays all its taxes. Appearing before a US Senate subcommittee in 2013, Apple chief executive Tim Cook claimed the company paid all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We dont depend on tax gimmicks, he added. We dont stash money on some Caribbean island. But a year later, under pressure from the European Union, Irish officials began to crack down on the loop hole. In 2017, US authorities gave companies until the end of 2020 to end the system. Google now appears to have acted. In a statement, it said it was reacting to changes in US tax law designed to limit the ability of companies to cut their US tax bills. For more than a decade, Dutch, Irish and US tax law allowed Google to enjoy an effective tax rate in the single digits on non-US profits, estimated at around a quarter the average tax rate in overseas markets. Filings seen by Reuters showed that in 2018 Google moved 21.8bn ($24.5bn) through its Dutch holding company to Bermuda, up from 19.9bn in 2017. A date of termination of the companys licensing activities has not yet been confirmed by senior leadership, however management expects that this termination will take place as of 31 December 2019 or during 2020, the filing with the Dutch chamber of commerce said. Consequently, the companys turnover and associated expense base generated from licensing activities will discontinue as of this date. Under the Double Irish, companies shift taxable income from an operating company in Ireland to another Irish-registered firm in an offshore tax haven. Dutch tax law allows untaxed profits to be moved to a tax haven without incurring a withholding tax, so a Netherlands-based company is used in the middle of this sandwich. The Dutch Google subsidiary was used to shift revenue from royalties earned outside the US to Google Ireland Holdings, an affiliate based in Bermuda, where companies pay no income tax. This allowed Google to legally avoid triggering US income taxes or European withholding taxes on the bulk of its overseas profits. Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past 10 years, our global effective tax rate has been over 23%, with more than 80% of that tax due in the US, the company stated in the Dutch filing. After Donald Trumps tax reforms dropping the tax rate to 15.5% from 35% came into effect in early 2018, Apple announced plans to repatriate $252bn in cash over five years. But despite the end of the Double Irish and Dutch Sandwich, tax experts warn that little is known about how specific companies have adjusted their tax arrangements. Based on what we have been able to see in the past, there is no reason to think that planning [by multinationals] hasnt already evolved several generations beyond the kind of classic Double Irish that is now officially coming to an end, Chris Sanchirico, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told the Financial Times. In 2017 the Guardian and other outlets reported on the Paradise Papers, a huge trove of confidential documents regarding offshore investments. The reports revealed that Apple, for example, had found a new tax structure to exploit, routing international profits through Jersey. US multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes that deplete not just US tax collection but the tax collection of almost every large economy in the world, Ed Kleinbard, a former corporate lawyer and now a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California, said at the time.  This article was amended on 1 January 2020 to correct the timeline of events leading up to Irish officials cracking down on the tax loophole. ","836"
"2020-01-01T15:10:28Z","books","Books","TS Eliot’s intimate letters to confidante unveiled after 60 years","A collection of more than 1,000 letters from the Nobel laureate TS Eliot to his confidante and muse Emily Hale is unveiled this week, after having been kept in sealed boxes at a US university library for 60 years. The cache promises to offer an intimate insight into the poets life and work, and on the extent of his relationship with Hale, a source of speculation for decades. The 1,131 letters, which date from between 1930 and 1956, were donated by Hale to Princeton University Library more than 60 years ago with her stipulation they remain sealed until 50 years after either Eliots death, or her own, whichever occurred last. He died in 1965, and she in 1969. The two had met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1912, when Eliot attended Harvard. They rekindled their friendship in 1927, by which time Eliot had moved to England. He corresponded frequently with Hale, who was from Boston, and who taught drama at US universities including Scripps College in California. Eliot ordered Hales letters to him to be burned, according to biographers.    Letters between TS Eliot and Emily Hale displayed in Princeton, New Jersey. Photograph: Shelley Szwast/AP   I think its perhaps the literary event of the decade, Anthony Cuda, an Eliot scholar and director of the TS Eliot International Summer School, told the Associated Press. I dont know of anything more awaited or significant. Its momentous to have these letters coming out. Their relationship must have been incredibly important and their correspondence must have been remarkably intimate for him to be so concerned about the publication, he added. Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1888. His best known works include The Waste Land, The Hollow Men and Four Quartets. His letters to Hale began after the end of his first marriage to the Cambridge governess Vivienne Haigh-Wood. Scholars point to the first poem in the Quartets series, called Burnt Norton and named after a home in England Eliot visited with Hale, as significant because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been. Eliot married his second wife, Valerie Fletcher, in 1957. The Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, one of the editors on The Complete Prose of TS Eliot, said the poet was ashamed of his first marriage. The letters could reveal how close he and Hale were, and if they ever considered marriage, she said. Whatever else Hale was, she said, she was a link to the life he had left behind in the US. The 12 boxes, which include photographs, ephemera and clippings, were unsealed by Princeton University Library staff in October to be scanned for digital viewing at the library from 2 January. Susan Stewart, a professor of English at Princeton, who was present at the unsealing, said two senior librarians stood behind a table full of wooden crates wielding dual pairs of tin snips. They proceeded in tandem to snap the copper bands holding the crates and the wooden slats clattered to the table. She added that what little was known about the correspondence indicated Eliot wrote to Hale freely about his predilections, his fellow poets, and above all, his opinions as a reader. Daniel Linke, the interim head of special collections at the library, said there was minimal, if any reading, during the unsealing. He expected that scholars from around the world would be travelling to Princeton in the first few days. It will be the special collections equivalent of a stampede at a rock concert, he told the Associated Press.","578"

The east of England could also benefit from extra investment in the coming years and libraries are set to get more help to play a larger role in their communities. ACE will next month publish its 10-year strategy for the arts outlining its strategic visions and goals. It replaces its previous strategy, Great Art and Culture for Everyone, which covered the years 2010-20. In an interview with the Guardian, Serota recalled a salutary survey of 5,000 people who were asked what the arts meant to them, to which a number replied not very much. People were also asked if they listened to music and replied all the time.  Serota said: Theres obviously an idea about the arts which is about it being elitist. In sport they dont have any difficulty at all in recognising the difference between a knockabout game and the Premier League. They recognise there is the professional game and something they can be involved with on a Sunday morning. If we could get to the same position in the arts we would be well placed. It [arts and culture] is just something that is part of life rather than something which is over there and separate. Serota said a priority in the strategy would be to try to reach those people who are not participating. There are too many places that in order to see something of real quality you have to travel long distances. That could include more money for the arts in eastern England. It is interesting, looking at where the big investments have been made in recent years, Serota said. Frankly there has been more on the west side of the country than on the east, for various reasons. Manchester has been very successful. If you look up the east coast from the east Midlands to Newcastle  there are a whole range of towns and cities which need further investment. Helping artists early will be a priority. It will be about giving more support to writers, artists, composers at an early stage in their career so that they can make a career and then flourish. He said it was astonishing how many winners of the Mercury music prize had benefited from ACE support early in their careers, and not big sums. Maybe 10,000 to 15,000 to get help and on their way  it makes a difference at the right moment. Libraries, which have suffered badly in recent years due to government spending cuts, could get more help. Serota said: There is big scope when you talk about what is happening in high streets and communities for libraries to play a much larger role. Many are already. Libraries are trusted places. They are places people feel safe in. Sustaining libraries and helping them move into the 21st century is an important part of what the Arts Council should be doing.   Related: No more DCMS? Why Nicky Morgan staying as boss does not mean business as usual   Many in the arts are nervous about the future, unsure of the consequences of Brexit, how pro-arts a Boris Johnson government will be, and whether the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport will be scrapped or merged into another government department. Serota said he would be disappointed if the culture department went, but on the whole he was optimistic. I have to be. He added: Brexit will make us have to paddle even harder. The strength of the arts in this country depends partly on international exchange and having good companies work here but also being able to draw on international talent just as countries abroad draw on British talent. The exchange of individuals in that way is very important. I think Boris did demonstrate he recognised that when he was mayor of London. When he made his first speech as prime minister in Manchester, he mentioned the arts high in his list of priorities. So I think he understands and appreciates the value of the arts in themselves but also the value of what they can bring to communities. Serota became chair of ACE in 2017 after three decades in charge of Tate galleries. It has meant seeing far more theatre and dance than visual arts previews, which has been a thrill, he said. Asked which shows he had enjoyed recently, he mentioned The Arrival at the Bush theatre in London, Matthew Bournes The Red Shoes at Sadlers Wells and the National Theatres production of Three Sisters, a retelling of Chekhov by Inua Ellams that relocates the action to late-1960s Nigeria. It was a really bold production, he said, and a joy to see the NT filled with a different kind of audience from the one that would normally be there. To see that audience seeing things in that play that a British white audience didnt understand.","816"

At a presentation in July 2011, as the rival JJB Sports was on the verge of being counted out, Ashley bragged: Ill finish off JJB first and then Ill move on to JD. History so far shows Ashleys prediction to be half-right: JJB was carried off on a stretcher in 2012; however, not only did JD Sports decide to take Ashley on, it won easily on points  at least judging by the scorecards of total investor returns at the close of the decade. Partly, this result was down to blows landed on Sports Direct elsewhere, which resulted in Ashleys firm being relegated from the FTSE 100 in 2016.  ftse 100  However, while Sports Direct has struggled, JD Sports has ended the decade as the current FTSE 100 company that has rewarded its investors most over the past 10 years, with 1,000 invested in JD Sports in January 2010 now worth 32,700, thanks to share price rises and dividends. It is fair to say that Ashley was not the only one who did not see that coming. In fact, JD Sports, along with eight of the decades other top 10 performers who ended 2019 in the FTSE 100, were not even in Londons blue chip index at the beginning of the decade. Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, the stockbroker that compiled the figures, said: Only one of them was in the FTSE 100 on 1 January 2010. That was the London Stock Exchange [Group] and even that did not enjoy an unbroken run as a member of the index as it was demoted in summer 2010 and only rejoined in spring 2013. In other words, if you are looking for the really big winners, you are probably better off by starting to look in the FTSE 250. This harks back to [1960s and 70s investor] Jim Slaters assertion that elephants dont gallop  meaning that the established giants of the FTSE 100 simply cant grow fast enough to necessarily generate these sorts of meteoric returns.  ftse 250  The flipside of Slaters point can be seen by studying a separate list of the most valuable shares in the FTSE 100 at the beginning and end of the 2010s. Only two names have dropped out of the list: BG Group, which was acquired by Royal Dutch Shell in 2016, and Vodafone, which in 2014 sold its stake in its American subsidiary Verizon Wireless and then handed the 18bn dividend back to shareholders. Tesco was the worst-performing FTSE 100 share over the past decade, giving investors a negative total return of 21.6%, according to the AJ Bell research. The retailer suffered a shocking decade that included three chief executives and numerous profit warnings as well as shelling out 235m to settle investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and Financial Conduct Authority into the 2014 accounting scandal. While Tescos bottom-of-the-table performance may have been partially self-inflicted, the company could also point to general sector issues, as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl increased their influence during the decade.    Tesco was the worst-performing FTSE 100 share over the past decade. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images   The rival supermarkets Sainsburys (which gave investors a 12.9% total return in the past 10 years) and Morrisons (+9.1%) were also in the top 10 of FTSE 100 worst performers. During that time when those two grocers produced those tiny shareholder returns, the FTSE 100 rose by 40% and gave a total return to shareholders of 104%. The banks also all largely seemed to have poor decades, perhaps for obvious reasons, with Royal Bank of Scotland (total returns minus 8.5%), Barclays (minus 8.8%) and Standard Chartered (minus 17.9%) all suffering. Energy stocks also gave investors a miserable 10 years. They were booming as we entered the last decade., with the consensus view that economic growth in China would carry share prices higher still.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  As is often the case, that consensus proved to be horribly wrong. BP was among the worst-performing FTSE 100 shares with a total return of only 19.2%, while in the FTSE 250 oil stocks such as Premier Oil (total returns down 60.8%), Cairn Energy (minus 45.6%) and Tullow Oil (where returns slumped by 89.9%) dominated the indexs laggards. Meanwhile, oil services and equipment providers such as Petrofac (minus 28.3%) hardly performed much better. During the decade the FTSE 250 rose by 135% and gave a total shareholder returns of 209%. Still, consensus being wrong does not mean gloom for all investors because another retailer also showed how you can make stellar returns despite a decade of challenges and woe on the UK high street. Games Workshop returned a magical 2570% to its shareholders since January 2010, as demand for its tabletop war games has swelled. AJ Bells Mould said: [Games Workshop] also shows how retail can still work, if you have the right products for your customers at the right price point and provide them in the right channel formats. The company looks after a well-defined community and does it very, very well.","860"

AJ: It is a great feeling to be involved with such important games. I have been working hard. It has been a long time coming but I am happy to help the team. It has been a hard time for me and I am happy to turn it around. It has been tough. I had a good feeling. The last game and now this game, I had a feeling I could make the difference. When Dunky gave me the ball I tried to hit it as hard as possible and then the only thing was the bicycle kick. I have done it and it went in the right direction, I think it was the best goal of my career.      2.33pm GMT   Safe to say that Alireza Jahanbakhsh has scored the goal of the decade so far, with apologies to Jack Grealish.      2.28pm GMT   Final score: Burnley 1-2 Aston Villa.

It was spectacular, and a deserved equaliser for Brighton who took the game to Chelsea, who suffered somewhat after Graham Potter made some attacking changes. Chelsea slackened off rather too much; Frank Lampard is likely to be peeved at his teams performance but relieved at the full-time whistle.

It sets up the last kick of the game, a free-kick chance from the edge of the area. Lewis Dunk takes it and its too tame to beat Kepa.      2.23pm GMT   90+4 min: Might Kovacic have been sent off? Trossard had spun away and that looked a tactical foul, and the Croatian had been booked. Lenient from the referee.      2.22pm GMT   90+3 min: Theres been some four minutes added on and the action has only just got more frenzied. Hudson-Odoi almost made amends for his earlier miss by heading back across goal for Abraham only for Webster to read the intentions and clear.      2.20pm GMT   90 min: Some handbags. The ball, and not the game, had gone flat so a drop-ball is called. Maupay chose to contest it, which is against the rules these days and is thus booked. No, I didnt know that rule, either.      2.19pm GMT   89 min: Kepa saves Chelsea! The ball came in from the right and Maupay had chance to score from eight yards out. He did everything right but Kepa had also guessed right, making a fine save with his legs and knocking the ball back out from danger.      2.17pm GMT   88 min: What a chance for Chelsea, and what a peeved expression from Frank. Abraham worked the space for Hudson-Odoi, who had the whole goal begging but missed.      2.16pm GMT   87 min: It was the classic overhead kick, by the way. Like Rooney v Manchester City, and perhaps with a little less shin involved.      2.15pm GMT   85 min: Jahanbakhsh took 18 months to score his first Brighton goal and then, jusy days later, followed it up with one of the best of the season.

Dunk won the header and he launches it into the net.     Alireza Jahanbakhsh scores with a spectacular goal. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters    Updated at 2.21pm GMT    2.12pm GMT   82 min: Trossard, Sussexs answer to Eden Hazard, tries some kind of Gordon Strachan-esque free-kick routine. He plays a short one, then hits the resultant pass, a moving ball, away from everyone. Wasteful.      2.11pm GMT   81 min: Connolly has been a livewire and it is his defiance that forces another attack from which Maupay is fouled by a Kovacic for another yellow card.      2.09pm GMT   80 min: Close! Brighton have a free-kick, taken by Trossard. Connolly controls the ball in a tight space and then turns to scuff a shot that Kepa has to deal with. Thats as close as Brighton have come.      2.08pm GMT   78 min: Connolly at last gets some space but then he loses his touch at a vital moment and the ball spills off for a throw. Brighton have suffered rather for a lack of composure. Montoya shows the same by smashing the ball willy nilly when a cross needed to caressed rather than walloped.      2.06pm GMT   76 min: Tammy Abraham takes a kick where the sun doesnt shine - unless you are an advocate of perineum sunning - from Bernardo in a clash by the sideline. Hopefully not too much harm done.      2.04pm GMT   74 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi comes off the left and looks to have an open chance at goal, only for Adam Webster to smell the danger and clear.      2.03pm GMT   73 min: Jahanbakhsh swings and misses the target as the ball spills. He cannot help but lean back and screw the ball wide.      2.02pm GMT   72 min: Chelseas free-kick after that Dunk foul drifts out of play. Off goes Mason Mount, and he will be replaced by Kovacic, who will try and protect the defence a little more than Mount might be capable of.      2.00pm GMT   70 min: Nice skill from Bernardo got Jahanbakhsh away but the Iranian was rather less than speedy. The breakdown of that move allows Tammy Abraham to buy Lewis Dunk the second booking of the game.      1.59pm GMT   69 min: First booking sees Zouma pile into Connolly and bounce the Irishman off his feet.     1.58pm GMT   68 min: Brighton change: Jahanbakhsh on for Mooy. That suggests Graham Potter sees speed being off the essence.      1.56pm GMT   66 min: First Chelsea sub: off goes Pulisic, who did OK, for Callum Hudson-Odoi, who is still yet to show his best since coming back from that admittedly awful injury. Both players may have the spectre of Wilfried Zaha to contend with if those transfer types are right.     1.54pm GMT   64 min: Jorginho makes an error in midfield and Maupay has the chance to play in Connolly, whose legs are pumping, only for Rudiger to come across. At the other end, James shot is deflected after Pulisic and Mount set up an attack.       1.52pm GMT   63 min: This game has heated up nicely. Not a huge amount of quality but there is a competitive edge.      1.51pm GMT   61 min: Rudiger enraged as he commits another foul on Connolly. His ire is not with the ref but Tammy Abraham for being too loose with the ball.      1.49pm GMT   60 min: Mooy tries to get the speed of Connolly away but Reece James shows real defensive anticipation in realising the danger and running the ball out of play for a goal kick.      1.48pm GMT   59 min: Brighton forge on but Proppers attempt at a cross swerves behind. In truth, the final ball has been poor rather too often from them.      1.47pm GMT   58 min: Kante fires in a snap shot that is saved by Ryan. Chances and openings at both ends now.      1.46pm GMT   57 min: Near daylight for Trossard, only for the Belgian to overrun the ball. Theres disappointment among the home fans over that one. That combo of Trossard, Maupay and Connolly carries a threat.      1.45pm GMT   55 min: Pulisic appears to be the out-ball of choice for Chelsea and he shows off his party trick in cutting inside, and blamming an effort at goal. And its wide this time.     Another effort from the dangerous Christian Pulisic. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA    Updated at 1.51pm GMT    1.43pm GMT   53 min: A rare Chelsea sojourn, with Azpilicueta on the burst. It comes to nothing. Then Rudiger is accused of a handball from a long pass forward for Dunk for Connolly...but Chelsea get an attack away and Pulisic powers the ball into the arms of Mat Ryan. Signs are that this is opening up.      1.41pm GMT   52 min: Chelsea have been unsettled by Brightons energy though Albion have not exactly threaded much together themselves. This game has betrayed the bleariness of the time of year; there is too much football.      1.40pm GMT   50 min: Connolly now chases down Rudiger. Good work from him. The plan appears to be stopping Chelsea being able to settle and Connolly is one of those players ideal for that approach, a ratter.      1.38pm GMT   49 min: Rudiger fouls Connolly by the touchline, with the young Irishman showing admirable strength for someone who is giving away at least half a foot in height.      1.37pm GMT   47 min: The belief appears that Chelsea can be got at so Brighton are going to try and attack. The opening moments, though, have been cagey.      1.35pm GMT   46 min: They are back underway and Graham Potter has made an adventurous change: on comes Aaron Connolly for Yves Bissouma. Brighton go for something approaching 4-4-2.      1.20pm GMT  Half-time: Brighton 0-1 Chelsea  Chelsea closed out the half on the attack, just as they began it but they were under pressure from a Brighton side that got better as the game went on and once Graham Potter made a tactical change. Cesar Azpilicuetas goal separates the two teams.      1.18pm GMT   45+2 min: Reece James still getting booed. Kante creates space and his switch of play gives Pulisic the chance to ping a shot on goal, just wide of Mat Ryans dive and the left-hand post.      1.17pm GMT   45 min: Three added minutes, mostly for that shoulder injury for poor Dan Burn.      1.16pm GMT   44 min: Brighton have gone like for like on Chelsea and look to have the stronger team at this point. Some ragged defending blocks off the excellent Maupay from having a chance.      1.15pm GMT   43 min: Brighton go close! Maupay goes down the channel and lays up Trossard, whose shot is whipped across goal and Kepa has to make a full-length save. Montoyas attempt at the rebound goes wide.     Kepa Arrizabalaga makes a decent save from Trossard. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters    Updated at 1.20pm GMT    1.13pm GMT   41 min: Aston Villa are 2-0 up on Burnley and Jack Grealish does have his goal this time. Life during VARtime can be terribly confusing.      1.12pm GMT   40 min: Brighton continue to dominate possession without ever looking like creating danger. Pulisic works back well to break up play and the pitchside mic catches a bit of his American twang.      1.10pm GMT   38 min: Chelsea trying to slow things down and take the sting out of a resurgent Brighton, though the home team do look a little short on the final ball. They are rather less than poised.      1.07pm GMT   35 min: Chelsea concede a corner after a Zouma brainfart, and Brighton force another when Kepa looks similarly panicked. Mooy took both of them and dangerously so, and another is forced for him to ping the ball into the area of uncertainty. Mooy gets another attempt when the third corner spills out but Abraham gets back for a fine defensive header; better from Brighton, who have at last stepped it up.      1.05pm GMT   33 min: Davy Propper got a little too excited when playing a through-ball and it drifts out. That may speak to Chelsea getting this game by the neck and forcing their opponent into anxious moments like that.      1.03pm GMT   32 min: Some rare territory for Brighton, though they have been edging into a Chelsea team keen to play on the break. They havent looked like creating a chance for a while, mind you.   Updated at 1.04pm GMT    1.01pm GMT   30 min: In other news, Aston Villa have actually scored now, and no VAR so Wesleys goal has been allowed to stand. Thats a big goal in the relegation battle.      12.59pm GMT   28 min: Reece James is getting booed for his clash with Dan Burn...Tammy Abraham shows his coltishness when he shoots instead of playing in Willian who was burning up alongside him and would have had a far better chance of scoring. Frank Lampards expression is peeved.   Updated at 1.00pm GMT    12.58pm GMT   26 min: Joe Pearson writes in: The man-bra is actually a high tech monitor, with gps and everything. Theyre really pretty cool.     12.55pm GMT   24 min: Pulisic, who has been decent so far, gets to ping in a cross, but there was nobody reading his mind.      12.54pm GMT   23 min: Bernardo took a while to come on. He needed to put on his shirt and that man bra thing that the players all wear these days. Are they a bit like those nose strips that Robbie Fowler and others used to wear back in the 1990s?      12.52pm GMT   22 min: The tall tree of Dan Burn has been felled by an aerial clash with Reece James, who went up for a header and caught his opposite number in the chest, though its his shoulder that appears to have sustained a problem. This is lengthy treatment and Burn leaves the field to be replaced by Bernardo who comes on at left-back.     Chelseas Reece James checks on Dan Burn who is helped off the pitch. Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea/Getty Images    Updated at 1.03pm GMT    12.49pm GMT   18 min: Aaron Mooy has been kept quiet but seems to have moved a bit deeper. He attempts a run but is cut off but that may be a signal that Graham Potter has changed things up.      12.48pm GMT   17 min: Willian looks to have a knock after running into the dreadnought also known as Dan Burn but should be OK to continue.   Updated at 12.48pm GMT    12.46pm GMT   15 min: Its been a decent start for Chelsea, this. Brighton have rather let them play with their narrow midfield...In other news: Jack Grealishs goal has been cancelled out for VAR.

In other news: Jack Grealish has scored for Aston Villa at Burnley.      12.43pm GMT   11 min: There was a slight delay there when Azpilicueta thought there was a tinge of VAR but he was onside and there was no push from the corner. A cheap goal to concede but Brighton had shown a soft underbelly.      12.41pm GMT  Goal! Brighton 0-1 Chelsea (Azpilicueta, 10)  Pulisic spreads the play, with James again in acres of space to force a corner. Jorginho takes and its flicked on. Abraham shoots, and the ball spills loose, and Azpi converts from close range.     Cesar Azpilicueta converts from close range. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters    Updated at 12.46pm GMT    12.39pm GMT   8 min: Its an open game, with Brighton allowing those full-backs to run on and Chelsea looking, as ever, a little vulnerable in defence.      12.38pm GMT   6 min: Both teams go close! Kante creates space for himself with a pirouette, and he slips on Reece James on the overlap. The shot goes wide but there is a warning sign for Brighton, who have narrow midfield. And straight at the other end, Alzate might have scored but for a deflection; Maupay had set him up.      12.35pm GMT   4 min: Willian, the key man against Arsenal, goes on a scurry, but Brighton cut off the danger this time around.      12.34pm GMT   2 min: Abraham escapes to the byline and his cross is deflected to Mason Mount, who hits the ball full on the volley but not past the first defender.      12.33pm GMT   1 min: Pulisic, down the left, is quickly involved, but he is crowded out equally as quickly.      12.31pm GMT  And away we go...  A toy town rave version of Johnny Cashs Ring of Fire gets us underway as referee Stuart Attwell gets wired for sound; looks like he was cut off from the VAR, which might not have been a great loss to the game depending on your point of view.      12.29pm GMT   The teams are out at the Amex. It looks like Chelsea are going four at the back, having made a couple of switches during the Christmas period. In fact, its pretty much 4-3-3 versus 4-3-3.      12.18pm GMT   Frank Lampard speaks. Ten years ago, he was Super Frank, Super goals.  I think the overriding factor from the Arsenal game was the spirit and the fight. We have been waiting for the players to do that which is just pure spirit and fight. There are things we can always improve and this game is a different animal, different opponent, a footballing team, one that will try and plau. I have a lot of respect for what Graham Potters done....(On ten years ago) I would say no chance, it was a thought maybe. The honour of managing this club is huge.       12.15pm GMT   Graham Potter speaks. Ten years ago, he was working at Leeds Carnegie University.   It would be nice to start off the year with a positive performance and a positive result. We are playing against a good team and its going to be a tough game but we are in a good place. We gave been struggling a little for results but performances have been good. It was nice to get a win in our previous game so hopefully we take that forward...Its been some decade.

Well, they arent quite as bad as Jonathan Wilson thought they might be, but then came that home defeat to Southampton to remind that the Bridge is rather less than a fortress these days. Then came that win at Arsenal which Frank Lampard really enjoyed, though he admitted his team had ridden their luck against an opponent who self-destructed almost as if as to show their new manager the depth of the challenge that awaits him.  For the final match of their festive flurry, a nice trip to the South Coast and a swill of some Sussex ales for the fans, but Brighton may be a tricky proposition. Potterball has taken the imagination of Albion fans, and results like the weekends defeat of Bournemouth, a peer club of greater Premier League cachet, will do nicely. Graham Potters task was to maintain safety and entertain the public far more than under Chris Hughton. So far, so good for the Premier League manager most likely to declare himself a fan of Ocean Colour Scene.  What better way to wake up those tired eyes and add ballast to those sagging dewlaps than this curtain raiser to the Roaring Twenties? Kick-off is at 12.30pm, GMT.  Updated at 11.24am GMT ","3066"
"2020-01-01T14:49:27Z","football","Football","Alireza Jahanbakhsh’s overhead stunner for Brighton denies Chelsea","The transfer window is open and, on the evidence of yet another careless attacking display, Chelsea need to dip into that 150m budget. Frank Lampard spent the majority of a scrappy contest bemoaning his teams sloppiness in the final third and they paid a heavy price, suffering another stumble in the race to qualify for the Champions League when Alireza Jahanbakhsh came off the bench to rescue a deserved draw for Brighton with an astonishing bicycle kick. Inconsistent and imprecise, Chelsea have not won successive Premier League games since the start of November and they could not complain after failing to withstand a spirited comeback from Brighton. Lampard, who was outmanoeuvred by Graham Potters tactical alterations, had much to ponder.   Related: Newcastle United v Leicester City: Premier League  live!   It was a disappointing effort from Chelsea and the lack of incision should convince the club to take advantage of their transfer ban being lifted as speculation mounts about moves for Jadon Sancho, Moussa Dembl, Wilfried Zaha and Timo Werner. It was an incredible equaliser but I think we deserved it, Lampard said. In the first half, if we are ruthless, the game is out of sight. We had opportunities to play people in who could score, to keep doing what we did in the first 20 minutes. We came off that slightly. We allowed them to feel theyre in the game and theyre a good team. The Christmas period has probably been a small showing of our season. Tottenham was a fantastic performance. Arsenal showed great spirit for a young group. Southampton, we struggled to break a team down and lost at home. Then today we should have the mindset to kill it and we dont. Lampard was fuming and he stonewalled suggestions Chelsea could include Olivier Giroud as part of an 80m deal to sign Zaha from Crystal Palace. The idea of that deal is something I have never considered, the Chelsea manager said. I wont talk about Zaha because he is not a player of ours. If we have to do business we will do it in the way we see fit, to try to make us better, and thats behind closed doors.   Related: Jack Grealish inspires Villa to victory at Burnley after latest VAR controversy   Nonetheless Chelseas forwards should be worried. Christian Pulisic flattered to deceive before being replaced by Callum Hudson-Odoi, who was just as ineffective on the left, and Willian offered little on the right. There was a lack of care in the decisive areas and Lampard grew irritable as the first half wore on, grumbling when Tammy Abraham spurned a chance to add to Csar Azpilicuetas 10th-minute goal, shooting when he could have released Willian. Not that it was all about the big teams failings. This was Brightons first ever point against Chelsea and they might even have snatched all three after Jahanbakhshs stunner, only for Kepa Arrizabalaga to repel Neal Maupays low drive. Arrizabalaga would also make a fine stop from Aaron Connolly, whose introduction at the break gave Brighton more urgency. I thought the players were amazing, Potter said. You go toe to toe with Chelsea and if you make mistakes they punish you. We had to adjust because our structure wasnt so good in the first half. We got better.    Csar Azpilicueta taps in from close range to give Chelsea an early lead at Brighton. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images   Chelsea, back to 4-2-3-1 after ditching their 3-4-3 system 34 minutes into their victory over Arsenal, started well, and took the lead after Reece James, included at right-back after a surprisingly quick recovery from an ankle injury, won a corner. Willian crossed to the far post, where Kurt Zouma headed down for Abraham to shoot from close range. Aaron Mooy blocked on the line but the ball broke to Azpilicueta, who turned in his third goal of the season. At that stage, with Brighton uncomfortable in a midfield diamond, Chelsea should have pulled clear. But perhaps it was too easy. Chelseasintensity faded and Brighton threatened before half-time, Maupay teeing up Leandro Trossard to test Arrizabalaga. Brighton, who will be without Dan Burn for two months after the left-backbroke his collarbone in a collision with James, were improving. Potter jettisoned the diamond and he made another alteration during the interval, removing Yves Bissouma for Connolly. The change meant Brighton were using a 4-4-2 and Potter was rewarded for throwing caution to the wind. Arrizabalaga denied Connolly but the breakthrough arrived when Lewis Dunks header led to Jahanbakhshs moment of magic. The Iranian winger had ended his long wait for a Brighton goal during last weekends win over Bournemouth and his second in two games means Chelsea must ask themselves some tough questions.","748"
"2020-01-01T14:46:09Z","music","Music","Sugar Sweet: the pilled-up rave that united Belfast during the Troubles","Doing music as a career didnt even register as something that was possible, recalls DJ, producer and composer David Holmes. Growing up in the Troubles, you just never felt things like that happened to people like you. Thirty years ago, Holmes was working as a hairdresser in a Belfast salon with fellow music obsessive Iain McCready. Holmes had been booking bands since the age of 15 and McCready was running underground hip-hop nights in the city. Were both blessed with a personality of not waiting around for things to happen, says Holmes. So we put on our own nights. On 23 December 1989, the pair launched Sugar Sweet  initially called Base and then briefly The Face  a night that brought acid house and rave culture to Belfast with a mighty thump. Earlier this month, the pair threw a one-off 30th anniversary party to celebrate. Throwing such parties wasnt straightforward, given the Troubles were still ongoing. Holmes was born in 1969, the same year British troops were first deployed in Northern Ireland (in an operation that lasted until 2007). We were a Catholic family living in a majority Protestant neighbourhood so we were open targets, he recalls. My house was pipe-bombed when I was four. I was in the bath. The Troubles was just a fucking lottery of death  people dying because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. While there had been a small and committed community of freaks running underground nights before this, things escalated with Sugar Sweet. When acid house came in, things really [changed], says McCready. Like everywhere else in the UK, the musical explosion came with a spike in ecstasy consumption. When the ecstasy boom hit, that turned so many people on to the music for the very first time, Holmes says.    Children playing among debris from hijacked burning vehicles after riots in west Belfast, August 1976. Photograph: Alain Le Garsmeur/Getty Images   The combination of political tension, exhilarating new music, euphoric new drugs and a brand new place to experience them was a potent concoction. Everything was so fresh and raw, says Holmes. All week youre getting searched, theres roadblocks, it takes three hours to get home  people are being shot on your fucking doorstep. But when youre living in that moment, you dont feel that youre being affected by it. Holmes and McCready could immediately sense the crowd letting go. If you spend Monday to Saturday living in fear and paranoia, once you cross into that club and youre hearing this music from all over the world, while being psychedelically intoxicated, all that shit just disappears, Holmes says. The Troubles manifests itself in your psyche in ways that you cannot even understand, so when youre on that dancefloor and religion isnt a barrier any more  the atmosphere was just beautiful. There was all this energy released. These communities fucking hated each other but among them you had groups of people whose religion was music. Many DJs were too scared to come and perform but the likes of Andrew Weatherall and the Dust Brothers (before they became the Chemical Brothers) played. Orbital named their track Belfast in homage. The Orbital night was insane, Holmes remembers. Chime was the anthem at the time and people were crying on the dancefloor  literal tears of happiness. People were becoming incredibly enlightened and having a really serious emotional reaction because of what was going on politically. Paul Hartnoll of Orbital remembers it as being special. It was incredible, he says. Wed play tracks like Satan and it used to clear dancefloors the length and breadth of the UK. In Belfast everybody stood there with their hands in the air and just roared with excitement.    Hartnoll not only remembers a surging intensity to the crowd but also deep gratitude. We did our set and we could not leave the stage. People were clambering on to shake our hands and say thanks. A demo track they had at the time needed a name and the city provided it. It was to try and give something back to Belfast that reminds us of our lovely time there and the warmth of the people. The night grew steadily until it filled its 500-odd capacity each month and queues formed to get in. The sound quality was a big pull. We always had the most amazing soundsystems, McCready says. In 1989 to spend over a grand to hire a system was a lot of money. It had to be brought in via an 18-wheeler truck. Another ace that Sugar Sweet held was access to acid houses Chicago heartland, thanks to Holmess mum. Due to the Troubles I had a brother who left Belfast for Chicago because his best friend was shot dead on the corner of our street, Holmes says. My mum would go and visit him, which was like winning the lottery. She found Gramaphone Records, the best dance music record shop, and shed bring back all these white labels. I didnt have a fucking clue what they were  it was proper raw dance music fresh out of Chicago. Aesthetically, the night was aiming for something like a psychedelic 1960s party. Projections of 16mm films were screened on to the walls, alongside giant weather balloons, and giant custom-made flags. Although they did end up accidentally looking a bit fascist, recalls Holmes. Because of the colour scheme and the SS for Sugar Sweet.    So much love in the room ... ravers embrace at Sugar Sweet. Photograph: Sugar Sweet   The close-knit music community in Belfast, along with reliable doormen, meant violence was unusual in the club. Nor did it become a magnet for police. The police were aware and Im sure they had a few undercover boys in, McCready recalls. But the people that were dealing were not operating along sectarian lines. It was people flying to London and buying a few pills to bring back. There was nothing dark or sinister going on in the background  it wasnt like paramilitaries were running drugs in the place. Holmes also suggests that while acid house might have been front-page tabloid fodder in England, it was less of a focus in Belfast. The police had bigger issues on their hands, he says. It went largely unnoticed here for a few years because of all the other distractions. Holmes recalls kick-out time for the club leading to some unusual scenarios. The lead singer of the Sandals was last seen wandering through Sandy Row, which is a real serious loyalist neighbourhood, wearing a womans dress with a lampshade on his head saying peace and love to everybody on the street.   That sense of togetherness, when youre staring down the barrel of a gun, gives you that extra bit of inspiration  David Holmes    The success of the club even led to a record shop of the same name. A beautiful example of mismanagement and naivety, laughs Holmes. It was such a badly run record shop. Wed have all these amazing records under the counter but wouldnt sell them to anybody until we [played them in the club]. The clubs cultural impact went further than the music, says Holmes, who went on to score films by Steven Soderbergh and Michael Winterbottom alongside a string of solo albums. It inspired so many people who didnt want to have a real job, he suggests. Theres something about that sense of togetherness, especially when youre staring down the barrel of a gun, that gives you that extra bit of inspiration to think, I want this to be more than once a month  I want it to be my fucking life. You can go down a very dark path in Belfast growing up during that time and I think the majority of people who came to this club chose something else. It had the same impact on Holmes and McCready themselves. We were going through the same experiences, Holmes says during a one-off anniversary party to celebrate. We were having the best nights of our lives. Ive DJd all across the world and none of them have come close to some of those nights at Sugar Sweet.","1297"

Francis lost his cool when the woman abruptly grabbed his hand and yanked him towards her just after he reached out to greet a child during a visit to the Vaticans nativity scene on Tuesday night.
The woman would not let go and in a gesture that appeared to cause him pain, he slapped at her hand before pulling his hand free.
During his Angelus address to a packed St Peters Square on New Years Day, the pontiff referred to his actions. I apologise for the bad example yesterday  sometimes even I lose patience, he said.
The identity of the woman is unknown, but a video of the incident went viral, prompting indignation on social media. One Twitter user wrote: What the pope did demonstrates one thing  hes a man.
In his address on Wednesday morning, the pope also condemned violence against women. He said: By how we treat a womans body, we can understand our level of humanity.
In another clip that went viral in 2019, Pope Francis repeatedly yanked his hand away from being kissed as a long queue of people came up to him. The waiting pilgrims had been attempting to kiss his papal ring as part of a tradition, practised by more conservative Catholics, to show respect to the pontiff. A few days after the incident, the Vatican said Francis had been worried about spreading germs. However, experts said at the time that his reluctance to have his papal ring kissed reflected an uneasiness with an element of traditional protocol that had lost its original meaning.","281"

A late Burnley goal flattered the home side a little, for in the first half in particular Villa were full of running and attacking ideas, with Jack Grealish pulling most of the strings. The only downside for Villa was the sight of Wesley and Tom Heaton departing on stretchers with knee injuries. Both may be out for some time. Well have to have scans before we know anything, Dean Smith said. Those are two big players for us and if we lose them it will take the gloss off this win a little bit. We havent been great on the road but we knew we had to be better than we were at Watford. We spoke a lot about that game and came up with a hell of a response. Villa enjoyed most of the possession in the first half, used it well and would have turned round even further in front but for the latest VAR outrage. Grealish was most certainly not offside when he skipped away from Phil Bardsley to meet Ezri Konsa Ngoyos 11th-minute cross with a glancing header but  after the goal had been given and the ball placed on the centre spot ready to restart  it became clear Stockley Park scrutineers were checking whether Wesleys heel was closer to goal than that of James Tarkowski. They decided it was, though the fact the deliberations lasted more than two minutes gave a clue as to how tiny was the margin.   Related: Newcastle United v Leicester City: Premier League  live!   The Villa fans at the other end of the ground vented their anti-VAR feelings in the now familiar way, as well they might. The way the technology is being used in this country is anti-goals and anti-excitement, and you dont get up early on New Years Day and brave the M6 to put up with that sort of nonsense. Baffling, was Smiths verdict. Not that Villa let the injustice bother them. They kept pressing forward, kept catching Burnleys defence square with the accuracy of their passing, and just before the halfhour were rewarded with a splendid goal. Predictably Grealish was again involved, interpassing with Wesley on the edge of the area before his lofted return found the striker with room to turn and volley past Nick Pope.    Players wait to hear the VAR decision from Stockley Park. Photograph: Rich Linley - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images   The Turf Moor crowd started to berate the home defence for allowing Villa too much time and space on the ball, though the message went unheeded. On the stroke of half-time Burnley stood back and watched as Villa moved the ball smartly from right to left across the edge of the area, until Douglas Luizs pass gave Grealish the opportunity to weigh up his shooting options. Bardsley unwisely stood off the Villa captain as he first shaped to attempt a curler into the topright corner before summoning the accuracy to find the top-left instead. Grealish has shown time and again this season what he can do in these situations and closing him down quickly is a defensive imperative.   Related: Alireza Jahanbakhshs overhead stunner for Brighton denies Chelsea   Sean Dyche sent on Jay Rodriguez for the second half and he nearly pulled a goal back almost immediately, shooting too high with little time to react to Tarkowskis driven cross, though at the other end Villa might have extended their lead but for Pope keeping out an effort from Douglas Luiz. Burnley put the Villa defence under sustained pressure in the second half without ever really looking like scoring until Wood popped up at the far post to nod in a cross from Ashley Westwood, the tall strikers glaring miss from a good position a few minutes earlier being more typical of their afternoon. We were a long way short today, especially in the first half, Dyche said. It looked like we were waiting for someone to give us something, and you cant play like that in the Premier League.

French officials say almost 2,358 people were picked up in the Channel attempting to reach the UK by boat or swimming in 2019, compared with 586 in 2018. In total in 2019 there were 261 crossings or attempted sea crossings, mostly by small, overloaded inflatable craft, leading to four deaths. Fifty-five percent of the attempts were unsuccessful. The most desperate attempted to swim the Channel, which is 20.7 miles across at its narrowest point. On Tuesday more than 40 migrants, including eight children, were intercepted in the Channel by the Border Force. Dozens more, including a pregnant woman, were picked up in the Channel in the days after Christmas. On New Years Eve an inflatable craft, carrying six males with hypothermia, according to French rescuers, was intercepted after getting into difficulty nearly seven miles (11km) north of Dunkirk. The migrants were taken to Calais. In the last year, the number of attempted crossings has soared despite repeated warnings from the French authorities and migrant support organisations of the danger in the Channel, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, from traffic, strong currents and icy water. The police prefecture in Calais, the port city where 95% of migrant boats set off from, said the action plan announced by the French interior ministry in January 2019 was working. In the last year, 55% of the crossings have failed because of the strong mobilisation of French forces on land and sea, said the Pas-de-Calais region prefect, Fabien Sudry. After meeting the British home secretary, Priti Patel, in August, the French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said it was in both countries interests to stop irregular crossings of the Channel. The Home Office said patrols on French beaches had doubled and drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment had been deployed to deter crossings. It said it had sent back 125 illegal migrants who had arrived by sea in 2019 to show its determination to return those entering the country illegally to Europe where they should seek asylum. Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said France needed to do more to stop boats setting off from its coast.","381"
"2020-01-01T13:10:21Z","sport","Sport","Dom Bess gets chance for second spin on Test cricket wheel of fortune","When Ed Smith named his first England Test squad as national selector, it was notable for two contrasting cricketers from Somerset. The first, Jos Buttler, had long since left that nest and his wings expanded yet further from that point. As of this week he has MBE next to his name but the other who turned out for England against Pakistan last summer, Dom Bess, has been invisible since. That is until Friday in Cape Town, where he has bolted back into the box seat for inclusion. That he was called up to this squad on the basis of a veritable pandemic  now striking 17 of the touring party and support staff  suggests a mood of desperation given how far Bess, now 22, had ventured from prominence. However, they are also similar circumstances to those that won him his debut. Then, Moeen Ali was out of favour having placed white ball above red after a shocking Ashes series and Jack Leach, who took over as principal spinner, was injured. Now, the former is again on the T20 circuit after losing his Test spot and contract after Australia tore his confidence apart in the Ashes opener last August, while the latter has spent the past week in quarantine, hit hardest by the bug that has decimated the ranks.   Related: Englands Jofra Archer an injury doubt for second Test against South Africa   Bess found out about his debut selection when Smith called him as he was sofa shopping. To then, in a whirlwind two years he had claimed five bags of five with his off-spin in his first six County Championship starts, another on debut for the England Lions in Antigua, before making a ton for the MCC in the annual season-opening fixture. Suddenly, he was readying himself to become the youngest finger spinner to represent his country in a Test with Vic Marks  the Lord of this Parish, and another Somerset tweaker  presenting the cap. The next fortnight was eventful. At Lords he was wicketless and largely ineffective with the ball but compiled an assured 57 with the bat  mostly alongside Buttler  to give the hosts faint hope from an otherwise dire match. At Headingley, Bess made 49 further impressive runs (coming in as the nightwatchman) before claiming his first three England wickets. He also snaffled a spectacular one-handed catch off Jimmy Andersons bowling, the veteran superstar who he could well end up replacing as Joe Roots side reconfigure for the second Test. But when the Test side reassembled to play India in August 2018, he was overlooked for the returning Moeen. There were comforting words from Smith of Besss outstanding all-round contribution against Pakistan but there was a problem: he was no longer getting a game for his county. Already into the wilderness, Bess was demoted to Somersets second XI barely a month after contributing to a Test win. So often the lot in life of a spinner when competing for one spot, Leach  his county teammate too  was the senior man with no further room at the inn. Bess dismount from 2018 was a nightmare against Lancashire, given only four overs with the ball then dismissed to a wild heave with the scores level in a game that would be tied.    Dom Bess in action at Headingley against Pakistan in June 2018. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters   I got to the top of Mount Everest with the Test stuff and then fell off, Bess later reflected of the chastening experience. Somersets coach, Jason Kerr, observed that firsthand. It doesnt matter who you are thats incredibly tough, he says of the acute fall. He had this meteoric rise where everything he touched turned to gold and was playing at Lords in a Test Match. To deal with that immense high and playing second-team cricket just a few weeks later, it was a turbulent time and he found it very difficult. But he has matured a hell of a lot and is much clearer in terms of knowing there are only certain things he can control. Hes a much stronger character now and will be a much better cricketer for it in the long term. The turbulence morphed into a move during 2019, albeit on a temporary basis, to Yorkshire. A product of the Somerset Academy, he was now on loan at the ground where he played most recently for England. Alas, after four starts (and a later spell at Leeds in the T20 Blast), Bess was back to Taunton for the final stretch of the season. On his return, he claimed his first five-wicket haul for two seasons, finishing with 26 scalps at a useful average of 26. It is easy to get his head turned regarding having certain opportunities, Kerr says of Yorkshires interest in Bess, with Kent also apparently sniffing around. Hes obviously very ambitious and wants to get back to the giddy heights of international cricket sooner rather than later. But we have been very transparent with him: we think he is an incredibly talented cricketer. We certainly want him to be at Somerset for the long haul. He obviously has competition at Somerset but is still one of the better spinners in the country. We have to try to find a way to keep them both.   Related: 'Ridiculous  I'm not a fan': four-day Tests plan meets player resistance   Amid the volatility, Bess remained in the thinking of decision-makers to the extent he was taken on a Lions spin camp in Mumbai this winter. There, under the tutelage of Sri Lankas Rangana Herath and the former England twirler Richard Dawson, he impressed sufficiently to become the man to call for when Leach fell ill. Coming in hot, he has already bowled himself ahead of Matt Parkinson, the leg-spinner originally sent on tour in support of Leach. His strength with the bat surely stands out in the memory too, given the long tail who were exposed twice against South Africa when an all-pace attack was deployed. Whether Bess is ripe for the challenge at Newlands  especially for bowling long, frugal spells to keep the seamers fresh  the coming days will tell. Yes its likely that, unless he can win selection as much for his batting as his bowling, come April he will be back to second-team cricket  again behind Leach  and it may take a while before this is no longer the status quo for club or country. Or he may bowl the house down and turn that thinking on its head. After the past 18 months, what is certain is that he wont be lacking for motivation.

"2020-01-01T13:00:05Z","lifeandstyle","Life and style","Beat the clock: the surprising psychology behind being perpetually late","Sometimes, one of my psychotherapy clients will be late. The tube got stuck; I do apologise. If it happens once, I dont treat it as significant. But some clients are perpetually late  perhaps just five or 10 minutes, but always  and out of breath when they get to the door. Then I am curious about what is behind their pattern of lateness, what it means and what purpose it serves. There are probably as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually late people. Sometimes it seems unfathomable, but not always. One client remembered that his mother always spent so long in the bathroom that she made him late for school. She told him that it didnt matter, and early people are uptight anyway. In his unconscious, being on time for things had got mixed up with being disloyal to his mother and therefore bad. Once he had found this narrative, he lost his compulsion for lateness. Punctual people may believe that late people are passive-aggressive and that their time is more valuable than those who wait for them. But reasons for lateness are generally more complex. The reason may be the opposite of arrogance. It could be that they dont value themselves enough. If this is the case, might they be unable to see how others could possibly mind their non-appearance? This explanation may work for social situations, but why miss planes, boats and trains? Perhaps it is an unconscious testing of the theory: If I were a worthy person, the train would wait for me. Since it doesnt, the feeling of not mattering is reinforced. One client I had kept thwarting her own attempts to succeed in her career, and bad time-keeping was part of this. When we unpicked what success would mean to her, she uncovered an old family belief that people with money were evil, bad people. Faced with a choice of not progressing or being evil, it was no wonder she kept up with the self-sabotage programme. Late people often have a sunny outlook. They are unreasonably optimistic about how many things they can cram in and how long it takes to get from the office to the restaurant, say, especially if it is nearby. My book editor and I often have lunch in a cafe next door to her office and she is always seven minutes late, because she leaves at 1pm. I think she believes she possesses a teleporter, yet, by the time she has chatted to a colleague in the lobby and waited for the lift, she is seven minutes late. I am considering getting there seven minutes late myself, except, as an early person with my own set of neuroses, that would make me ill with anxiety. Lateness can also be caused when we have a reluctance to change gear  to end one activity and start another. We dont like getting up, we put off going to bed. Stopping something we are absorbed in to do something else can be annoying. It takes willpower to carry out. But if we dont change gear in time when someone is waiting for us, we are in danger of being judged as selfish. Some late people choose to accept that they are terrible timekeepers and that they cant do anything about it. Yet punctual people think they know that late people could decide to be on time and follow through. It is only when the latecomers make the decision to be punctual that they change. It must be a conscious decision; if they merely make a woolly attempt to try to be on time, they wont be.","603"

The decision from US district judge Loretta Biggs could have big consequences in North Carolina, a key state in the 2020 presidential election that is scheduled to hold its presidential primary on 3 March. Donald Trump carried the state in 2016, but Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, won in 2016, by just over 10,000 votes. This weeks ruling was a blow to state Republicans, who overrode a veto from Cooper to enact the law last year. The measure came two years after North Carolinas previous voter ID law was struck down as part of a host of voting restrictions a federal appeals court said targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision. African Americans make up about one-fifth of registered voters in North Carolina. Turnout among African Americans dropped six percentage points from 2012 to 2016.   Related: Voter purges: are Republicans trying to rig the 2020 election?   Voters approved a constitutional amendment to require voter photo ID in 2018. But the new voter ID law, Biggs wrote Tuesday, didnt fix the discrimination present in the old one. She noted many of the same lawmakers pushed the new law and had openly said it was designed not to fix discriminatory issues, but to survive further legal challenge. The legislature sought ways to circumvent state and federal courts and further entrench itself, she wrote. This iteration of the North Carolina law required voters to present one of 10 forms of acceptable identification, such as a drivers license, passport, or military ID in order to vote. But Biggs noted that minority voters in the state were less likely to possess an acceptable form of ID. She also noted that African American voters were more likely to have public assistance and government IDs  both of which were largely not considered an acceptable form of voter ID under the law. The evidence suggests that minority voters are not just less likely to have an acceptable form of ID, but that the legislature excluded photographic ID that could have greatly reduced that discrepancy, she wrote. Biggs also appeared unconvinced that certain provisions in the law would mitigate the impact on black voters. While the law provides free ID to anyone who cannot afford one, she noted that those who need ID might not be able to spare the time to travel to the DMV to get one, even if it was free. She also wrote that a provision allowing people to vote if they swore they could not get ID could lead to confusion among poll workers. In addition to blocking the voter ID measure on Tuesday, Biggs also stopped a provision in the law that allowed poll watchers to challenge someones ballot if they did not have acceptable photo ID. She ordered state election officials to publicize that voter ID would not be needed to vote in the state until she issued a further ruling.  This article was amended on 2 January 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Biggs noting that African American voters were more likely to have military IDs, when government IDs was the correct reference.

But after heavy rainfall brought parts of northern England and the Midlands to a standstill, it became the centre of a media frenzy. Approximately 140 of about 200 homes in the village were swamped in sewage-contaminated floodwater after the River Don burst its banks. Its hard to describe just how serious it was, its a miracle nobody was killed, said Peter Pridham, a churchwarden at St Cuthberts, which has acted as a storage hub for vast amounts of food, clothing, toys and cleaning products donated to residents since 8 November. What came through the village started as a flood and turned into a sort of miniature tsunami as a large volume of water broke through. On a bone-chilling Wednesday in mid-December, a day after the final main road into the village had been reopened, only the mud, debris, and skips brimming with ruined furniture lining Fishlakes roads remained as obvious evidence of the deluge. But, for residents, the chaos continued.   Related: The flooding in Fishlake  a photo essay   Many of those whose homes were severely damaged are still in temporary accommodation outside the South Yorkshire village, while a number have taken to living in caravans on their own driveways, including Joanne Ambler, a mental health nurse, and Chris Dewrow, a builder, both 54. Sorry about the smell, said Ambler, leading the way through the couples scarred bungalow on Grove Road, a cul-de-sac that has been particularly devastated. Weve lost everything. Last week we went out, and I hadnt even got makeup  its things like that that remind you. The past month has been particularly difficult for the couple, as Amblers father died a fortnight before the flood. I havent even had time to grieve for him because its all happened at once, said Ambler, who will return to work in January after taking time off to come to terms with the situation.    Joanne Amblers bungalow was flooded. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian   In the living room, where a dehumidifier constantly whirred, a knee-height line where the water reached was still visible on contaminated blinds. But the couple, who are sharing their motorised home with their two pet dogs, will have to wait for the go-ahead from their insurance company before reparation works  which are likely to take months  can begin. Residents who are either not covered for flood damage on home insurance, or are yet to receive payouts, have so far been eligible for two recovery grants to help with immediate needs  500 from Doncaster council, and 200 from a local charity, South Yorkshires Community Foundation. A few doors down, a retired couple, Mary and Craig Elliot, were packing the last boxes of their salvageable possessions to store at a friends home after visiting the church to stock up on tins of food. They have been living between relatives and their caravan in Scarborough since the floodwater rose up to the windowsills in their bungalow. Craig is scathing of the help they received from authorities, claiming it had been too little too late. He added: We asked [the council] for sandbags and they brought three for the street. Once wed flooded, they sent the army in. Im not knocking the army lads because theyre doing what theyre sent to do, but they said, Do you want sandbagging? and I said, What, to keep it in? The interior walls of the bungalow, which are shrouded in black mould from the damp, will need to be stripped back to bare bricks before refurbishment can start, but a month on, the Elliots were also waiting to find out how much damage their home insurance would cover.    Craig Elliot packed possessions to store at a friends home. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian   In the absence of so many residents, Fishlakes pub, the Hare and Hounds, was deserted at lunchtime. In the fortnight after the flood, it offered refuge for affected residents and their pet dogs. Although Doncaster council will pay for mud-stained carpets and upholstered seats to be replaced, its owners, Angie and Scott Godfrey, are still feeling the strain. The Old Butchers cafe, co-owned by Claire Holling, has also made financial losses, on account of its staff spending three weeks largely cooking free food  including curries donated by a Muslim charity based outside Doncaster  for residents and rescue workers. We havent been getting any income. Its had a massive impact on our business and its going to take a while to recover, said Holling. Still, she added, from the start of the flood, putting the village first had been a given. Theres always been a strong sense of community in Fishlake with it being such a small place, but its definitely got stronger, said Holling. There is clear evidence for her assertion. On Christmas Day, despite their own woes, the Hare and Hounds laid on a free dinner for 41 people unable to cook at home. Lives have been blighted by last months events and ensuing battles to restore homes in Fishlake, but for residents such as Ambler, the sense they were not alone has ensured they remain unbroken. Weve spoken to more people since the flood than we have in the 15 months weve been living here, she added. When you see the amount of help that has been given, its so moving it makes you want to cry.","885"

Caroline Barlow filed an employment tribunal claim after finding that 15 men in equivalent roles in her division were paid more than her. The BBC denied Barlows allegations, but in May it agreed to an out-of-court settlement on condition that Barlow formally withdrew her claim.

The BBC presenter Samira Ahmed launches a landmark equal pay case, claiming she has been paid 85% less than her male equivalent.
Ahmed asks for hundreds of thousands of pounds in back pay for her work on the BBC programme Newswatch, for which she was paid 440 an episode. She argues that her male equivalent is Jeremy Vine, who was paid as much as 3,000 a show for his work on the Points of View programme. The tribunal takes evidence for several days and will return a decision at a later date.

(January 1, 2020)  

The BBC approaches women who are bringing equal pay cases against it to discuss potential settlements, in an apparent attempt to head off a repeat of Samira Ahmeds employment tribunal.







The cases involve alleged incidences of unequal pay, which is separate to the wider problem of the gender pay gap. Equal pay cases allege that a woman was paid less than a man for doing the same or equivalent work for reasons of gender. At least a dozen long-running cases are understood to be still active, the former BBC China editor Carrie Gracie said in October.
During Ahmeds landmark case, she argued she was owed almost 700,000 in back pay because of the difference in pay between her 440-an-episode pay for the BBCs Newswatch and the 3,000 an episode Jeremy Vine received for Points of View. Both are short television programmes of similar length that deal with viewer feedback about BBC output. Ahmed claimed the pay difference was an example of gender discrimination.
The BBC denied the claim, insisting Newswatch was a journalistic programme that attracts a lower fee and requires a different type of presenter to Points of View, which is an entertainment programme. Its lawyer said the higher salary was justified because the show required a host such as Vine with a lighthearted cheeky manner who would often dress up, citing occasions when he wore a hat.
At the tribunal, in which Ahmed was supported by other female BBC presenters in a show of solidarity, the corporation was left in the uncomfortable position of trying to talk down the importance of its own programming. At one point the BBCs legal team described the entire BBC News channel  the flagship 24-hour service  as relatively niche, angering some of those who work there.
To make matters worse, an unredacted document featuring the names of more than 100 BBC female employees who were supposedly bringing equal pay cases against the corporation was included in the documents made available to journalists reporting on the case.
Both the National Union of Journalists and the BBC blamed each other for the failure to redact the documents, which led to some of those named complaining to the Information Commissioners Office and senior BBC bosses phoning those affected to offer their apologies.
There were also embarrassing details about the BBCs pay negotiations with Vines agent, in which he ended up with a deal worth about 1m a year, while Ahmed claimed she had been told by a senior executive the BBC doesnt do equal pay  something the corporation strongly denied.
Ahmeds tribunal verdict is due early this year, with potentially major consequences for the BBC and those bringing equal pay cases as they await the result of an investigation into the broadcasters handling of such cases by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The corporation is already facing pressure to reduce costs and further cuts could be on their way if the new Conservative government presses ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee.
A BBC spokesperson said the corporation had made significant changes to pay and grading over recent years, resulting in a large number of pay queries that were mainly addressed through internal processes and did not result in any changes to individuals pay, although a tiny percentage end up in dispute or tribunal.
Our approach to these cases has not changed. We continue to try to engage with our staff to resolve disputes where it is possible and appropriate. However, mindful of our obligations to the licence fee payer, we will robustly defend our position at tribunal if necessary.","684"

In his New Years Eve address, the president urged his centrist government to find a rapid compromise to end the protests that have run for four weeks and have disrupted transport networks. However, he sounded a more steely note by declaring the pension reforms will be carried out. Supporters lauded his determination as Macron offered an olive branch to opponents in talks that will restart on 7 January. The peace gesture, however, failed to defuse the tensions caused by the contested reforms; hardline unions said they were equally determined to continue their industrial action, calling for greater disruption and another day of mass protests on 9 January. These arent (new year) wishes, but a declaration of war against millions of French people who reject his reforms, Jean-Luc Mlenchon, the head of the hard-left France Insoumise (FI) party, said. The rest of his discourse sounded false and hollow. An extraterrestrial has spoken, he tweeted. Macron has remained out of the pensions fray until now, leaving his prime minister, douard Philippe, to deal with the crisis. Yves Veyrier of the Force Ouvrire union said he was disappointed the president appeared not to realise the French did not want pension reform. Opinion polls have suggested the country is in favour of pension changes, but not this particular reform, and in any case does not trust Macron to carry it out. I call on as many workers as possible to mobilise in support of those who are on strike so that they will end up hearing us, Veyrier said. The far-right leader Marine Le Pen of the Rassemblement National (formerly the National Front) dismissed the presidents speech. Once again  nothing, she tweeted. Olivier Besancenot, a former presidential candidate for the far left and one of the founders of the Nouveau Parti anticapitaliste said Macron prefers to present us with rubbish from his legendary world.  Its worrying to be so out of touch and contemptuous in the face of a majority refusing his proposals. The battle will carry on to the end. Macron gave his address wearing a sombre suit and tie and  unusually  standing in front of the French and EU flags rather than sitting behind a desk. He said he understood how decisions taken could hit people and raise fears and opposition, but added: Should we then give up trying to change our country, our daily lives? No. Because to do so would be to abandon those already abandoned by the system, to betray our children and in turn their children, who would be left to pay the price of our renunciation. That is why the reform of the pension system will be carried out. During his 18-minute speech, Macron also evoked Brexit, saying the UKs departure from the European Union was a challenge but that he would strive to maintain a solid relationship between our two countries. He also briefly mentioned the challenges of rebuilding Notre Dame Cathedral, devastated by fire in April last year, the environmental crisis and national unity. Eric Coquerel, also of France Insoumise, said the address was a call to arms. There are two worlds; the world of Macron and the world in which almost all the rest of French people inhabit  between these two worlds there is an ever-widening gap. Tonight, there was a lunar side to Emmanuel Macrons (new year) wishes. Ecologists were also disappointed. Julien Bayou, national sectretary of Europe cologie-Les Verts, said: We had to wait 10 minutes for him to finally mention ecology, for barely a minute, he said. Changing Frances complex pension system  currently 42 individual systems  was a plank of Macrons 2017 election platform. His government has proposed to create a universal points system. Unions, particularly those in the public sector, say this will remove hard-won rights and privileges, including early retirement on full pensions for those in particularly stressful jobs. Aurore Berg, an MP for Macrons La Rpublique en Marche (LREM) party, said the president had been extremely determined and extremely calm in the face of the challenges that face us. This is what we expect from a president of the republic. Were not here to listen only to the people on the streets, we are here to hear the voters and the mandate the French have given us, which was based on a clear pledge to carry out the necessary reforms, Berg added. Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, also hailed the presidents determination to act and his wish to unite the French. Tonight, the president has renewed our ambition: to transform our country, to build a society together and united, as always, the republic, he tweeted.  This article was amended on 2 January 2020 because an earlier version misdescribed Macrons government as centre-right and mistranslated remarks by Olivier Besancenot.","835"

The fire was likely to have been caused by Chinese sky lanterns that were set off amid New Years Eve celebrations and landed inside the zoo, police said on Wednesday afternoon. Local residents raised the alarm at 0.38am local time (2338 GMT) on Wednesday morning. When fire services arrived at the zoo shortly after, they found the tropical monkey sanctuary engulfed in a fire that could not be contained before the building had burned down to its skeletal structure. Our worst fears have become reality, the zoos management said in a message posted on Facebook. There are no surviving animals in the monkey house. Opened in 1975, the 2,000 sq-metre enclosure housed 10 great apes as well as numerous smaller monkeys, tropical birds and fruit bats. German media reported on Wednesday morning that more than 30 animals had been killed. A nearby open-air gorilla enclosure had remained untouched by the fire, the zoo said. A silverback male popular with visitors, Kidogo, and his family were alive and well. Two chimpanzees, female Bally and male Limbo, were also discovered to have survived the fire, in what the zoos director, Wolfgang Dreen, described as a miracle. However, German media reported that 48-year-old Massa, the oldest living silverback gorilla in the European endangered species breeding programme, had perished in the flames.    Fire services arrived to find the monkey house fully ablaze. Photograph: Alexander Forstreuter/AP   Investigators believe it is highly likely the fire was was caused by Chinese sky lanterns, also known as Kongming lanterns, which had been illegally set off in the city, police said at a press conference on Wednesday. Several witnesses had reported low-flying lanterns in the city on Tuesday night, and three lanterns with handwritten messages had been found near the zoo enclosure, a police spokesperson said. Setting off rockets and firecrackers in the streets is a key part of Germanys New Years Eve ritual, and the law allows citizens to light their own fireworks in public on 31 December and 1 January. In recent years there has been a growing debate about a ban on pyrotechnics, and about 30 German municipalities imposed partial bans on private fireworks this year. The sale of Chinese sky lanterns is already illegal in all German states bar the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, however. The Krefeld zoos management said several employees were still in shock and the site would remain closed to the public on 1 January.","428"

But Brexit, the US presidential election and the US trade war with China could all spring nasty surprises over the next 12 months and give the long-running bull market a jolt. The UK and Brexit Relief that Brexit is resolved will be replaced by anxiety over the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the transition period due to end in December 2020. Dean Turner, a UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts UK GDP will only rise by 0.9% in 2020, even weaker than the 1.2% in 2019. Its possible that there will be some bounce in activity given the clarity on Brexit, but any improvement in sentiment is likely to fade as the next Brexit deadline draws closer, Turner says. Ruth Lea, an economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, believes the UK will get a fiscal boost from the forthcoming budget, due in February. This could include an increase in the threshold for paying national insurance  in effect a tax cut. The economy has been facing the twin headwinds of Brexit uncertainty, which has almost certainly depressed business investment and could also have undermined the consumer, and the weaker global economy, especially in the eurozone. Having said that, there still seems to be growth, Lea says.    Boris Johnson faces further tough talks with Brussels that could hit sterling. Photograph: Pier Marco Tacca/Getty Images   The London stock market shrugged off Brexit anxiety during 2019 to post its best year since 2016. Several analysts predict it will rally in 2020 as relatively unloved UK shares are embraced by investors again. Jeremy Podger, who manages Fidelitys 2.7bn global special situations fund, says the City should benefit from the increased certainty created by the Conservative win in last months election. It appears to be the case that, in general, investors have been taking money out of the UK stock market since the referendum and that it is generally underrepresented in many international portfolios. This result could be a trigger for these investors to neutralise their exposure while existing investors are unlikely to sell for now, Podger explains. But the prospect of fresh tough negotiations between London and Brussels over their future relationship will probably weigh heavily on sterling in 2020. The UK could crash on to World Trade Organization trade rules in a years time if it cannot reach an agreement and refuses to extend the transition period. This would be a significant step down from the current arrangement and an arrangement that investors fear will negatively impact the UK economy, says Fiona Cincotta of City Index. Takeovers in the UK This year there could also be a rise in takeover activity. Jonathan Boyers, the head of mergers and acquisitions at KPMG, predicts a flurry of deals in the next six months now the UK has a stable government. Many of those who have been mulling over an exit have done their early prep work and are set to launch processes in the new year. Meanwhile, I expect there will be a significant amount of demand, keeping prices high, as the market makes up for some of the lost volume, Boyers says. Ben Higson, the head of the London corporate practice at law firm Hogan Lovells, also expects a dynamic mergers and acquisitions market in 2020. The removal of political uncertainty in the UK has resulted in early signs of confidence returning to deal-making activity, keeping boardrooms and other decision-makers busy in the final weeks of the year and, we expect, early in the new year, says Higson. Trump and US markets Donald Trumps attempt to win a second term is likely to dominate the headlines for much of the next 12 months. Markets often do well in an election year  partly because the White House incumbent has every incentive to make people feel richer. Trump is rumoured to be considering a fiscal boost known as tax cuts 2.0 which could lift his popularity, and stocks, before the November election. Many investors have priced in a Trump re-election, says Edward Moya of the foreign exchange firm OANDA. A Republican win has been Wall Streets base case for a while, so a Democratic win could startle the markets. Despite the strong economy, key battleground states such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania all have Biden leading Trump in recent polls. A Biden presidency would still be positive for US stocks but perhaps a few percentage points lower than a Trump victory, Moya points out. But if Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders were to beat Trump, tech stocks, banks and pharmaceuticals firms could all face tougher regulation, triggering a sell-off. John Moore, a senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, says political concerns are already being priced into some stocks. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has made no secret of her feelings about Facebook and a desire to break up some of the other tech giants. Other candidates have targeted healthcare, he points out. On average, Wall Street strategists predict the S&P 500 will gain 5% in 2020, compared with a 28% rally in 2019. Trade disputes Trade tensions could escalate in 2020, particularly if the US intensifies pressure on Europe. Last month the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, criticised the very unbalanced relationship in trade across the Atlantic, signalling it was a White House priority for 2020.    Donald Trump with Xi Jinping. The US and China are due to sign a trade deal but the dispute could flare up again, leading to the reimposition of tariffs. Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP via Getty Images   Lighthizers comment imparts a high risk of an escalation of tensions, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. He fears that a US-EU trade war would inevitably tip the German economy into recession. The US economy is enjoying its longest expansion ever, having been growing for more than 10 years. Fears of a recession in 2019 proved unfounded, but the trade tensions stirred up by Trump are bad for growth. Trade tensions will continue to foster unpredictability in economic policymaking and cause a drag on demand and capital investment, predicts Los Angeles-based Hercules Investments. China and the US are due to sign their phase one trade deal this month. But there is a risk of this dispute flaring up again, leading to tariffs being reimposed on imports. That would have a chilling impact on the global economy. Chinas economy is also likely to keep cooling in 2020, having slowed to its slowest annual growth rate in three decades in 2019, at 6%. Beijing will keep trying to jumpstart growth in 2020, but Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist of IHS Markit, says China is fighting structural factors including an ageing population and weaker productivity growth. We predict Chinas growth rate will slide even further, to 5.7% in 2020 and 5.6% in 2021, unless the government puts in place a more aggressive stimulus programme, Behravesh says. Markit also predicts that the US economy will grow by about 2.1% during 2020  below the 3% targeted by Trump. Its manufacturing sector has slowed in recent months, but Decembers jobs report did beat forecasts  an encouraging sign for Trump. Central banks Central banks will, once again, have a major impact on the financial markets  beyond their traditional remit of price stability. The US Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates on hold but could cut borrowing costs if economic data turns sour. In Europe, Christine Lagarde is overseeing a review of the European Central Banks operations, with a new focus on the climate emergency. But shes not expected to change the ECBs dovish approach, so interest rates could remain at record lows for some time. In the UK, interest rates could be cut if the UK economy fares badly once Brexit takes place on 31 January.

This halving, likely to take place in May, should reduce the supply of new bitcoins. The two previous times when the block reward was halved, bitcoin rallied strongly afterwards.

The title story of South Korean author Kim Young-has collection is a first-person narrative with a journal structure that nods to Gogols Diary of a Madman, and like its Russian progenitor charts the descent into dementia of an alienated protagonist. Septuagenarian Kim Byeongsu has long retired from murder, but when a rival practitioner appears in his neighbourhood, and his adopted daughter Eunhui risks becoming a victim, he decides to use his old skills to terminate with extreme prejudice a threat he himself once posed. But hes beginning to forget, and to lose any faculty for this harsh act of redemption. Along with the publication in English of Un-su Kims The Plotters last year, Diary of a Murderer is part of a wave of dark fiction coming out of South Korea (Im tempted to dub it K-noir). Both works invite us to empathise with habitual killers (in Un-su Kims novel it is a hit man), but they also share the political context of a country that has only recently transitioned from dictatorship to democracy, bringing with it the wider danger of a social amnesia. In The Plotters a new free market gives rise to a major boom in the assassination industry, as corporations replace the state as clients. In Diary of a Murderer Kim Byeongsu looks back on the homicidal atmosphere of an authoritarian regime in which his crimes could go almost undetected. While everyone was trying to catch the phantom that was communism, he muses, I was doing my own hunting. Kim employs a wry, detached style throughout this collection. Theres much dark humour, which spills into absurd comedy in his final tale The Writer, an erotic fable set in the publishing business. At times it all seems a bit too coldly ironic, but there are flashes of emotion behind the deadpan wit. In Missing Child a boy recovering from a kidnapping is unable to break the maternal attachment he has for his female abductor. Emotional displacement is the heart of the matter and Kim reminds us of the peril, in our personal lives as well as in society at large, of forgetting our history.

The 2010s have been marked not only by the global movement of people across national borders but also attempts by governments to erect walls and fences in their path. Weve seen nationalism winning votes and the worldview of the far right mainstreamed.   Related: It should have been a great decade for the European left  what happened? | Cdric Durand   Flow, flood and crisis. Media imagery and language has shaped public opinion. Of course, migration from the global south to the north  intimately connected to the legacy of colonialism and the wests military machinations  has been happening for decades. But the 2010s has seen a higher number of people from the south moving towards the north. In particular, Europe has seen hundreds of thousands of people from Africa, the Middle East and south Asia, fleeing chronic poverty, political instability, wars, and the climate crisis in countries often laid to ruin by western-backed institutions. Libya had always been the migratory destination for many sub-Saharan Africans because of its employment opportunities. Following the suppression of the 2011 Arab spring and Natos intervention in Libya, a lawless society emerged, with racial hatred against sub-Saharan Africans unleashed. Many escaped forced labour and torture, climbed into dinghies and began the dangerous sea journey across the central Mediterranean. But when they landed in Europe, they didnt come to safety. Instead, they found themselves in the centre of a white, Eurocentric discourse  a problem to be blamed for societys ills. Throughout this time, when tens of thousands died at sea trying to reach Europe, Europe has imagined itself to be the victim of a migrant or refugee crisis. The concept of a crisis caused by the movement of people into the European continent has always been embedded in the Eurocentric way of seeing things. This rupture brought about by the arrival of the other creates anxiety and fear in the European mind, as the sociologist Encarnacin Gutirrez Rodrguez has pointed out  thus the need to create neverending irrational, ideological justifications for that anxiety and fear.    Since Italys then-interior minister Marco Minnitis agreement with Libya in 2017, Italy has fended Africans away from European waters. Photograph: Simona Granati/Corbis via Getty Images   This can be seen in the way migration into Europe has been portrayed as an invasion of different cultures and a clash of civilisations  in a way that is similar to the justifications of the colonial era where the colonised were cast as racially inferior beings. Colonialism still casts its shadow over the immigration debate. For Europe, the other challenges its way of being as its presence is a reflection of Europes past imperialism, upon which much of the continents wealth was built. In the past decade, weve seen anti-migrant policies and racism flourish across the world. The EU implemented the hotspot system, filtering people and categorising them as asylum seekers or economic migrants. Europes patrolling of its southern borders intensified, resulting in deals with Turkey and Libya. Since Italys then-interior minister Marco Minnitis agreement with Libya in 2017, Italy has supplied technical support to the Libyan coastguard, fending Africans away from European waters. Restrictions were also imposed on NGO search-and-rescue activity in the Mediterranean. These policies under the centre-left Democratic party (PD) were later continued and elaborated on by the hard-right Matteo Salvini of the League from the summer of 2018  and now carry on under the PD/Five Star coalition. Thousands have died as a result. Back in the 1970s, the critic and writer John Berger depicted Turkish migration to Germany in A Seventh Man, which charted migrant workers journeys in Europe through their departure, work and return. The return represented the future, where a worker could travel freely and see lives improved for his family when he visited home. But in the 2010s, this cycle has been disrupted  many migrants and asylum seekers irregular status prevent them from visiting home. Instead, they are forced to live invisible lives, illegalised, entrapped and segregated. In Britain, the Conservative government has persistently refused to receive refugees  only 3% of asylum applications in Europe are lodged in Britain because refugees are commonly denied entry. In 2016, when the refugee numbers were at their highest across the continent, Britain only received 38,517 applications for asylum, compared with 722,370 applications in Germany, 123,432 in Italy and 85,244 in France. Britain, simply put, has one of the lowest refugee acceptance rates in Europe. Plenty of efforts have also been made  see the Home Offices hostile environment  to make life unbearable for asylum seekers and migrants in Britain. Over the decade, I have witnessed asylum seekers leading a subhuman existence, deprived of rights to work (despite the substandard state support) and made to pay for healthcare. They live in desperate limbo, pushed into the world of exploitation and forced labour. As a Chinese builder said to me: If you didnt die in the back of a lorry, you could die working here. And there are many migrants who are effectively imprisoned. Throughout this decade, I have visited many people detained in Dover and Yarls Wood removal centres, held without time limit, and despite committing no crime. Today, Britain remains the only European country to practice the indefinite detention of asylum seekers and migrants. Over this Christmas, 1,826 people were incarcerated in these centres.   Related: This was the decade the USs self-serving myths fell apart | Aziz Rana   While large numbers of people across the globe continue to be denied freedom of movement and illegalised, their determination to survive will not be defeated by walls and borders.

We can join them by fighting for the regularisation of peoples immigration status  but also by challenging the system that enables their marginalisation and racial segregation. We must offer a different way of seeing migration; a real alternative that addresses colonialism and the massively unequal world that it has created.

It was business as usual for Rooney, finessing his free-kicks in anticipation of pulling on a Derby shirt for the first time after signing an 18-month contract as a player-coach in the summer. The past five weeks have served as a watching brief, with the former Manchester United player contained to the dugout as part of Philip Cocus staff. But Englands record goalscorer returned home to play, and the wait is almost over.   Related: How will Derby and Phillip Cocu manage the world of Wayne Rooney?   When the move was first mooted, Derbys players on the coach home from an opening-day victory at Huddersfield assumed links to Rooney were a wind-up. However, that rather bizarre image of Rooney navigating the muck and nettles of the Championship, to borrow Neil Warnocks description of the division, is about to become a magnificent reality. Rooney, almost three years on from surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as Manchester Uniteds greatest goalscorer, is expected to make his Derby bow against Barnsley on Thursday after the club submitted the relevant paperwork to the Football Association and the EFL at midnight on Tuesday to formally register him when the transfer window reopened. In an instant, Rooney will become the Football Leagues biggest superstar. Last season it was Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, this time around Cocu and Rooney are the coups, high-profile signings and headline arrivals orchestrated by the Derby owner, Mel Morris. The club are 17th, nine points off the play-off places, but they hope Rooney, a Champions League and five-times Premier League winner, can ignite an indifferent season. Rooney, too, is desperate to make a difference and finish his playing career on a high. Since arriving he has trained with the rest of the squad as planned but has also been on a tailor-made fitness programme  a mini pre-season regime  to help him get up to speed. Where Rooney plays remains to be seen but the 34-year-old is expected to operate in midfield, possibly as a No 10 in Cocus preferred 4-2-3-1 system.    Rooney on the ball at Derbys Moor Farm training centre. Photograph: Andy Clarke/Shutterstock   Rooney may no longer be in his pomp but Derby are rightfully excited to unleash their not-so-secret weapon. Understandably, there is a hum of excitement surrounding his Derby debut and supporters have been singing Rooneys name ever since he was introduced on the Pride Park pitch before a draw against Queens Park Rangers in November. It was then he took a pew in the second row of the home dugout for the first time, behind Cocu and his assistants, Twan Scheepers and Chris van der Weerden. During the victory over Charlton on Monday  Derbys first win in eight matches  supporters in the South Stand made it known that Rooney is coming to town. I feel physically good, he said. Of course, Im not the player I was in my early 20s but I havent missed a training session since I rejoined Everton [in 2017]. I feel my body is still ready to play and Ill play as long as my body allows me.   Related: Championship at halfway: West Brom soaring with Leeds in close company | Ben Fisher   The past month offered a glimpse into the future, with Rooney observing Cocu and his staff at close quarters, studying how they deliver analysis clips from a coaching perspective, and sitting in on team meetings. On the pitch he is expected to become a key link, a bridge between the dressing room and management and, while there is a sense he may assume some coaching responsibilities next summer, for now his primary focus is on playing. Since his arrival Rooney has impressed staff with his attitude, notably his down-to-earth nature and tangible hunger to drive Derby up the table. During his first training sessions, Rooneys unerring speed of thought was particularly striking. Off the pitch he has been priceless for both youngsters and experienced professionals, giving snippets of advice to players at half-time, while he has acted as a sounding board for Mason Bennett and Tom Lawrence, who were charged with drink-driving in October in an incident that led to Derby sacking their former captain, Richard Keogh. Keogh has appealed that dismissal and the club await an EFL hearing. Only the bottom club Wigan have scored fewer league goals than Derby this season and Rooneys creativity and touch will surely help solve that problem. You can be standing right behind him but you dont see the pass he sees, says the Derby defender Matt Clarke. He is just a level above.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  Then there is Rooneys experience, nous and game-management, skills that will be invaluable throughout the second half of the season. Rooney has already had an impact on Derbys younger players, notably the 18-year-old midfielder Jason Knight, who scored both goals on Monday. He almost reminds me of myself when I was younger in terms of no fear, Rooney said. It is impossible to predict quite how big a splash Rooney will make but his arrival has already given Derby a timely boost. It has given everyone a lift, says Clarke. When he first came into the building, everyone was a little bit in admiration and almost starstruck to a point, and rightly so because arguably Englands best ever player is around the training ground, having breakfast and having lunch with you. But he has just become one of the lads now, which is a nice thing. In training he has scored goals from crazy angles and chipped the keeper from a position where no one else would even attempt.

Asghar Badshah, 39, who had been missing for a month, was discovered after police forced entry into the building in Batley on Sunday. Two men, aged 27 and 30, and a 41-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. Both men have since been released under investigation, while the woman is on bail pending further inquiries. DCI Heather Whoriskey, from West Yorkshire police, said Badshah, who was from Bradford, had been reported missing on 4 December. She added: We believe he was last seen in the early hours of 30 November and I would appeal to anyone who has witnessed any suspicious activity in Commercial Street around that time or since to contact my team, so we can establish if this is linked to our investigation. In a statement, his family said: We as a family are deeply shocked and devastated by the loss of our dear brother Asghar Badshah. His beautiful smile and charisma, as well as his generosity will never be forgotten. [We] please ask for privacy during our time of grief as our elderly mother is deeply upset at this time. We pray for justice for Asghar and appeal to the public for any assistance they can provide to the police in this investigation. The building on Commercial Street had been previously occupied by Yorkshire Bank, but has been disused since the branch closed in 2016. Neighbouring shops and businesses were temporarily closed following the discovery. Tracy Brabin, the MP for Batley and Spen, told the Telegraph & Argus: This was a serious and worrying incident and I cant imagine what it must be like for the friends and family of the victim.","303"

Halloween Kills Following a fairly ecstatic reception for Jamie Lee Curtiss series comeback in 2018, Laurie Strode and Michael Myers return for another battle, again directed by David Gordon Green. No spoilers, but Halloween Ends has just been announced for 2021, so we suspect both characters may emerge from this film vaguely in tact. A Quiet Place Part II    John Krasinskis character may be dead, but hes back as director for this follow-up to his smash hit film about a family  headed by his real-life wife, Emily Blunt  who must live in silence lest they alert only-auditory monsters to their presence. That film ended with a possible solution; this one introduces substantially more characters and Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou have joined the cast.

"2020-01-01T11:15:02Z","commentisfree","Opinion","The New York Times ran a disturbing op-ed. But the backlash misses the mark","Just three days before the dawn of the third decade of the 21st century, one of the worlds top newspapers published a column by one if its full-time opinion contributors arguing that one ethnic group is inherently more intelligent than others. In this case, the superior ethnic group in question was, unsurprisingly, that to which the writer belongs.   Related: New York Times columnist accused of eugenics over piece on Jewish intelligence   I wish I were making this up. I cant believe I had to type those words. As the novelist Gary Shteyngart wrote on Twitter: Woke up to a New York Times op-ed about one group being intellectually superior to others and citing a paper co-authored by a white supremacist as evidence. The op-ed in question, by columnist Bret Stephens, was called The Secrets of Jewish Genius, and the white supremacist Stephens invoked  from ignorance, one hopes, rather than malice  was the late anthropologist Henry Harpending. Harpendings work has been repeatedly and spectacularly debunked by far better scientists, and most recently rejected as unfounded in March 2018 on the pages of the New York Times itself. Its too much to expect Stephens to read the newspaper for which he works, I suppose. Within a day, the Times appended an editors note to Stephens piece, explaining that it removed the reference to Harpendings paper and to Ashkenazi Jews in general. The bizarre note also denied the column said what it said: that Ashkenazi Jews are inherently superior to others, including Sephardic Jews. Sadly, the morning the column debuted, Twitter commentary lurched from biting and witty takedowns of Stephens to calls to boycott the New York Times over the foolishness of one of dozens of contributors to but one section of a massive multimedia news and entertainment company. (Disclosure: I occasionally write op-eds for the Times.) Although the harsh criticism of Stephens and the Times was completely warranted, in other respects the response  especially the calls for boycott  was misguided. Such posing not only simulates real political action, it displaces it, satiating ones need to feel like one has done something. This is an example of a non-boycott boycott, narcissistic stunts we have seen emerge with targets like Starbucks and Facebook in recent years. Before anyone says What about South Africa? or What about the lunch counters during the civil rights movement?, yes, specific, targeted, organized boycotts that generate real financial harm and demand serious sacrifice or risk by participants can effect change. But none of that is happening with these hashtag eruptions. Potentially effective boycotts are focused, local, disciplined, and have specific, articulated goals and demands. They must bring public shame and measurable financial harm to a firm. A few people tweeting Im going to stop subscribing to the Times because of Bret Stephens does not rise to the level of successful social movements or tactics. If one believes, in the absence of evidence, that a few dozen Twitter users canceling subscriptions to the New York Times would affect decisions at the Times, one does not understand the incentives embedded in the attention economy. The Times, like most other globally available web publications (including Breitbart and any number of white supremacist sites), benefits from umbrage as much as applause. Futility aside, to threaten to withhold revenue to any respectable news publication at this moment in history is hard to justify. We need quality journalism, expensive investigations, and bright commentary more than ever. The Times, for all its flaws, overwhelmingly delivers all of these things. The Times has serious lapses in judgment and reporting  like any publication, including The Guardian  but we should not wish for a day when The New York Times does not exist. A fake boycott of the Times would be meaningless at best, counterproductive at worst. What can we do about the Bret Stephens problem, then? The only reasonable and potentially effective response is to push at what the leaders of the Times care about as much as their revenue: their reputation for seriousness and responsibility. Shaming the Times works better than threatening the Times. You cant put essential history like the #1619Project and bullshit race science under the same masthead without giving credibility to the lie, entrepreneur and critic Anil Dash wrote on Twitter. The stakes are higher than ever with daily concerted attacks on the idea of accurate information itself, and the NYT is failing at this. James Bennet, the editor of the opinion pages of the Times, does not have to invoke Bret Stephens promotion of eugenicist garbage to fire him, as moral a decision as that might be. Bennet could just fire Stephens for being a weak thinker and a weaker writer. Bennet could hire so much better  and has. There is a vast surplus of underemployed smart and talented writers in the world. Bennet has managed to hire some of the best of them, along with some remarkably shallow and lazy writers, like Stephens.   Related: Iraq riots expose an America weaker and with fewer options   In an attention economy, we should promote and publicize work that undermines racism rather than promotes it. This is one of the few decent ways to respond to any publication that publishes mostly essential work along with occasional horrifying content. Every publication tracks its reader engagement. Signalling that quality work can generate attention is our only reasonable response to a perverse media economy and poor editorial judgement. Shteyngart concluded his tweet about Stephens with a sentiment we should all hold close to our consciousness. The 2020s will be the most difficult decade in modern history. I hope we can face it with laughter and love.  Siva Vaidhyanathan is a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.

"2020-01-01T11:15:02Z","commentisfree","Opinion","Ignore the purists and food zealots. There is no such thing as 'authentic' cuisine","With food politics, it is tempting to want to categorize dishes as your own, especially as a second- or third-generation Asian American. Growing up in southern California, 20 minutes from Orange countys famous Little Saigon district, I was raised on ph restaurants with linoleum floors, Formica tables and servers who openly chided my weak accent. You cant get more Vietnamese than that, and I took pride in it. Later, as a college student in New York, I started work at a ph restaurant in Greenwich Village. I applied to the job, where I still work today, in part because I wanted to be a starving artist without actually starving, but also because I thought it would connect me to a Vietnamese community that was otherwise difficult to find in New York, where there is only a small Vietnamese population. On my first day of work, I clocked in to discover that almost all the workers were Chinese or Latinx. There was not much of an ethnic connection, but I stayed anyway and was trained by the two owners, a pair of half-Vietnamese, half-Chinese men who had gentrified the menu for the Greenwich locals and college students. Fish sauce was generously renamed Vietnamese chili, and pigs feet became spicy pork knuckles. The owners were meticulous about decor, and invested in photogenic placemats, a stoop covered in florals and palm leaves, and a bar framed with painted army helmets and a neon noodle sign. Introduce yourself to customers and check up on your tables, they told me. This isnt Chinatown. Ive served thousands of people since my first day, and have read every Yelp and Google review. Because of our English menu and appeal to customers who eat with their eyes, our lowest ratings often describe us as trendy, white-washed and inauthentic. Vietnamese customers, especially out-of-towners from areas with large populations of Vietnamese, such as San Jose or Houston, delight in asking if our owners are Chinese (we are trained to say no), ordering in Vietnamese to Cantonese servers, and remarking loudly, Only two basil leaves? The beef is already cooked? We should open our own Vietnamese restaurant. Our head cook is half-Vietnamese, and we often tell customers about how he grew up in Saigon as the first line of defense when people say we arent Vietnamese enough. As the only full Vietnamese, Ill be sent to Vietnamese customers to drop a few xin chos and cm n anhs, even though we shouldnt have anything to prove. French, Italian and other European restaurants are rarely held to the same standards of authenticity, so why do minority cultures, and particularly Asians, cling to traditional food so tightly? The 20th century saw a wave of Asian immigrants who opened restaurants as a means of survival, a ready money source even if you couldnt speak English. In recent years, Asian Americans have been entering the restaurant business or innovating their parents stores because of culinary ambitions, or to uphold a family history, rather than because it is their only option. Like their parents or grandparents, they are businesspeople; although passionate about their cultures heritage, they are less interested in one singular way to cook. Yet their biggest critics are often other Asian Americans, who want food they can have authority over, claim as their own and use to bolster their identity credibility  even though authenticity is difficult to pin down and impossible to quantify. Its fine and admirable to open a restaurant with altruistic goals for its impact on community and culture. But many restaurants are still mainly a means to feed ones family and the employees on payroll. Yes, our restaurant caters to American tastes and is designed around American ideas of Vietnam, but were also the most frequented ph joint in the area, and were helping introduce more people to Vietnamese food as well as pay our bills. When 10lb-bowls of ph and ph burritos went viral, I was a bit pained to see a Vietnamese staple turned into what I deemed a business gimmick, and mixed with a different cuisine at that. But recipes arent stagnant, and neither is culture. Vestiges of French colonization are abundant in Vietnamese food, from Caf du Monde coffee to bnh m baguettes, but these are now considered inherently Vietnamese, even as we distance ourselves from an imperialist past. Im no less Vietnamese because Ill enjoy an inauthentic vegan ph, or a bnh m made by a Senegalese cook. There is no such thing as authentic food. Eat what you want, and enjoy it. There are more important hills to die on.  Mai Tran is a writer based in New York. ","774"

Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images   The Madame X Tour  in which Madonna plays small venues for the first time since 1985  has had good reviews and bad publicity in equal measure. The audience in Las Vegas booed her when her show started two hours late, and one US fan attempted to sue her for it  but critics rushed to acclaim the performances. We shall see when she comes to London, where the most expensive tickets are an eye-watering 1,200.27 January16 February, London Palladium Fatoumata Diawara The Malian singer-songwriter has carved out a unique niche for herself, combining an acting career with an impressively wide-ranging approach to music thats seen her collaborate with everyone from Herbie Hancock and Bobby Womack to Damon Albarn and Disclosure. It highlights a disinclination to be pinned down that also informs her solo work: her last album, 2018s Fenfo, ran the gamut from traditional Malian kora to 60s soul influences.Tour begins 30 January, Roundhouse, London Carly Rae Jepsen Carly Rae Jepsens career has never again scaled the commercial heights of her 2012 hit Call Me Maybe  the song with the greatest chorus of the 21st century according to Billboard  but she has instead developed into one of pops more intriguing characters, wresting control of her own artistic direction, making consistently fascinating albums, including 2019s Dedicated, and gaining a noticeably older audience than her peers.Tour begins 7 February, Victoria Warehouse, Manchester The Hu    Unique  the Hu. Photograph: E Altankhuyag   Never let it be said that rock music no longer throws up anything unexpected: the Hu garnered 25m YouTube views for their 2018 debut single Yuve Yuve Yu, on which the Ulaanbaatar quartet melded heavy metal with Mongolian throat singing. Their debut album The Gereg became a global hit in 2019, a sign that theyd hit on something truly unique.Tour begins 8 February, Chalk, Brighton Tame Impala: The Slow Rush The Slow Rush is the first album by the expansive Australian psychedelicists for five years, and the follow-up to Currents, which established them not merely as an adventurous musical force but an influence on mainstream pop. Rihanna covered one of its tracks, New Person, Same Old Mistakes; frontman Kevin Parker went on to collaborate with Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Travis Scott. Judging by the tracks that have trailed it, The Slow Rush elaborates on the synth-heavy direction of its predecessor.14 February Nrija    Dynamism  Nrija.

But the band really come into their own on stage, adding a rawness and dynamism to their improvisations.18 February, Village Underground, London The 1975: Notes on a Conditional Form The three singles thus far released from the 1975s delayed fourth album have encompassed everything from two-step garage and distorted, yowling punk rock to monologues from Greta Thunberg. Who knows what else it might contain? Not every avenue the 1975 try to head down yields perfect results, but theres something laudable about an arena-packing band so determined to avoid resting on their laurels.21 February Grimes: Miss Anthropocene Grimes fifth album has had a tortuous gestation: initially scheduled for 2018, it was delayed amid arguments with her record label and considerable personal strife, including the death of her former manager and negative media coverage of her relationship with Elon Musk. It is apparently a dark concept album about an anthropomorphic goddess, which aims to make the notion of climate change fun. We shall see.21 February Lana Del Rey    A most memorable year ...

Her sixth album, the Joni Mitchell-influenced, Laurel Canyon-set Norman Fucking Rockwell!, topped a lot of critics end of year lists. Some publications went so far as to suggest it is one of the albums of the decade. The tour that bears its name has already visited the US and the Middle East. Her career-spanning set apparently ends with the albums epic, 10-minute long centrepiece Venice Bitch.Tour begins 25 February, O2 Arena, London Jpegmafia Barrington Hendricks promoted his third album of experimental hip-hop under the Jpegmafia name as a disappointment. No one else seemed to agree with that assessment, though. It was more approachable and melodic than his past work, yet its sound remained chaotically eclectic  hes claimed influences from both Ol Dirty Bastard and Throbbing Gristle  and his stream-of-consciousness vocal style was as manic and provocative as ever. How its glitchy collage approach works live remains to be seen.Tour begins 27 February, EartH, London Michael Kiwanuka    Balanced  Michael Kiwanuka. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer   The Guardian called Michael Kiwanukas eponymous third album  a song cycle displaying the influences of gospel, psychedelic soul and Jimi Hendrix, co-produced by Danger Mouse and London hip-hop auteur Inflo  one of the greatest albums of the decade, evidence of how finely crafted its songs were, and how perfectly it balanced the retro and contemporary. In addition, he is a gripping live performer, capable of expanding his material without seeming indulgent.Tour begins 1 March, O2 Academy, Birmingham SEED Ensemble Saxophonist and composer Cassie Kinoshis 10-piece band are in the thick of Londons young jazz revival: their lineup shares members with Sons of Kemet, Kokoroko and Maisha.

Their recent live shows have been impressive too, spiking the usual classics with deeper dives into their back catalogue.Tour begins 16 March, Manchester Arena Baxter Dury: The Night Chancers    Darkly comic  Baxter Dury. Photograph: Record Company Handout   Baxter Dury already had a cult following, but his last album, Prince of Tears, was a considerable step forward and one of 2017s best: musically eclectic, its lyrics alternately thoughtful and scabrously funny, the sound of an artist finally coming into his own. The menacing, darkly comic single Slumlord  a jaded view of the world of social media, packed with scary people saying silly shit  suggests its follow-up is of the same standard.Released 20 March Caribou Its five years since Dan Snaith released an album under the Caribou name, the brilliant Our Love. In the interim, he has seemed more preoccupied by his straightforwardly dancefloor-facing alias Daphni. All of which makes Caribous forthcoming return with a new album, Suddenly, and a series of live dates, all the more welcome. The single You and I suggests there has been no dip in the quality of his warm, melancholy electronica.Tour begins 30 March, Brighton Dome Trippie Redd 2019 was a good year for Ohio-born, LA-based rapper Trippie Redd. His mixtape A Love Letter to You 4 entered the US charts at No 1, evidence of his shift from Soundcloud cultdom to mainstream success. Stylistically varied or hopelessly unfocussed, depending on your perspective, its best moments suggested an artist who could turn his hand to anything from guitar-heavy emo rap to straight-up club bangers.Tour begins 4 April, Brixton Academy, London Harry Styles    Devotion to the cause ... Harry Styles. Photograph: NBC/Getty Images   Styles has by some distance the most successful solo career of any ex-One Directioner. There have been more takers for his brand of pop-by-way-of-classic-rock than his former bandmates dalliances with R&B and Sheeran-esque acoustic whimsy. Whether recently released second album Fine Line will repeat the commercial performance of his eponymous debut remains to be seen, but the level of devotion Styles inspires suggests it will.Tour begins 15 April, Birmingham Arena Nick Masons Saucerful of Secrets Saucerful of Secrets, in which the Pink Floyd drummer and a range of musical associates including Spandau Ballets Gary Kemp charge through key tracks from Pink Floyds pre-Dark Side of the Moon repertoire, could well have flopped.

Its also pleasing that experimental music can end up in venues this big.Tour begins 26 April, Wembley Arena, London Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Nick Caves most recent live activities have involved solo performances and an unmoderated audience Q&A  a kind of IRL version of his Red Hand Files website, where fans are invited to ask him anything. This tour, however, brings back backing band the Bad Seeds, in the wake of their wildly acclaimed 2019 album Ghosteen. It will be intriguing to see how that albums beatless songs work in arena-sized venues.Tour begins 2 May, Birmingham Arena Unclassified Live An offshoot of Radio 3s beloved Unclassified show, this series of gigs at the Southbank Centre pitches modern classical composers against artists working in the field of electronica. Owen Pallett and Daniel Avery offer new compositions in earlier instalments, but this final show features electronic sound artist Tim Hecker alongside composer Daniel Elms. 7 June, Royal Festival Hall, London Thom Yorke The Radiohead frontmans solo tour is named after his 2014 album Tomorrows Modern Boxes rather than its 2019 successor Anima. He is accompanied by producer Nigel Godrich and visual artist Tarik Barri providing live projections. Thus far, the setlist has occasionally taken in Radiohead tracks, but largely concentrated on Yorkes solo oeuvre and the work of his supergroup Atoms for Peace. By all accounts, the live performances add a drive and focus to his experimental electronica.Tour begins 19 June, SEC Centre, Glasgow Diana Ross    In for a treat ... Diana Ross.

But Glastonbury is merely one stop on a UK tour, and if the setlist is anything like that of her acclaimed Vegas residency  heavy on Supremes hits and her Chic-produced disco era  its going to be a treat.Tour begins 30 June, Leeds Arena Taylor Swift This years British Summertime gigs in Hyde Park include a pop extravaganza headlined by Little Mix, and Pearl Jam performing with the Pixies as support, but the pick of them may be the arrival in the UK of Taylor Swifts self-styled Lover Fest, wherein she eschews her usual stadiums in favour of taking her most recent album around the worlds festivals. The Lover album is open fields, sunsets, + SUMMER, she explained on Instagram. I want to perform it in a way that feels authentic.11 July, Hyde Park, London Billie Eilish    Acclaim  Billie Eilish. Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters   The breakout teen sensation of 2019, whose debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? spawned five US platinum singles, returns to the UK for a series of arena gigs. The sense that her home-produced brand of dark electronics, adolescent psychodrama and gothic sci-fi imagery is a cut above has been bolstered by critical acclaim and comparisons not to her pop peers, but Nirvana  the latter courtesy of Dave Grohl.Tour begins 21 July, Manchester Arena Stormzy You can get a sense of how far Stormzy has outstripped his UK hip-hop peers by the sheer geographical variety of dates on the tour supporting his second album, Heavy Is the Head. His sound is still rooted in British grime, as evidenced by recent single Wiley Flow, but his gigs take in not just Europe but the Middle East, China and Australasia. The biggest shows, however, will be in Britain: a stadium-sized victory lap.Tour begins 2 September, O2 Arena, London Elton John    Extravaganza  Elton John on his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour. Photograph: Mackenzie Sweetnam/WireImage   The mammoth Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour enters its third year with a string of UK dates. Thus far it has proved notable not merely for its vast commercial success  the first leg alone grossed $125m  but the degree of acclaim its received. It is a beautifully staged two-and-a-half-hour extravaganza in which the hits are rolled out with considerable gusto  apparently for the final time.Tour begins 2 November, O2 Arena, London Classical and opera Prisoner of the State Beethoven will dominate the concert schedules in his 250th anniversary year, and his only opera, Fidelio, gets a new production at Covent Garden, with Lise Davidsen and Jonas Kaufmann heading the cast.

The real prize for the backers of the 24-country competition, which launches the 2020 season in three cities across Australia over the next 10 days, is the soul of tennis. There will be sceptics lining up to see it fail, of course. They will point out it is an innovation too far, coming less than two months after the revamped Davis Cup, which used an eerily similar format for 18 finalists and which was marketed as the World Cup of Tennis.   Related: 20 for 2020: the unmissable sporting events over the next 12 months   The cautious supporters of the new competition include Tim Henman, who will captain the Great Britain team and is yet to be convinced there is room in the games calendar for the two team cups as well as the exhibition Laver Cup. In an ideal world, no, he said, as Great Britain prepared for their opening tie in Sydney on Friday, against Bulgaria in Group C, without Andy Murray  who nominated Henman for the job. I am interested in how the ATP Cup works. There is a large number of players, and it is in a large country approaching the Australian Open. There is a lot to do. Underpinning the latest grab for the loyalty and bucks of the games worldwide audience of millions is a turgid rivalry between the organisers of the two competitions, one towards the end of the longest season in sport, and this one at the beginning. The Association of Tennis Professionals (an uneasy conglomerate who have their internal rows to sort out) have for years urged compromise with the International Tennis Federation, the games long-time guardians who grew more desperate by the season as leading players refused to fit the old home-and-away Davis Cup into their busy and lucrative schedules. It is a towering irony that the most innovative administrator the game has had in decades, Chris Kermode, has been levered out of his job as the ATPs executive chairman and president  the result of an unseemly feud with the world No 2, Novak Djokovic  on the eve of the launch of his latest experiment. Kermode will be watching his new baby from a distance, pleased at least that it will introduce many of the ideas he road-tested in the NextGen Cup for the games rising stars. By general consensus, the new Davis Cup, driven by the Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique and won by the home country on the back of another extraordinary contribution from Rafael Nadal, worked well enough, albeit with plenty of fine-tuning to be done before the next final there towards the end of this year. So the ATP Cup has to reach that benchmark at least and Ross Hutchins, the competitions managing director who will oversee its genesis in Brisbane, Perth and Sydney, scene of the final on 12 January, brings a smile and confidence to his task.    The British team take in the sights of Sydney (left to right: Jamie Murray, James Ward, Daniel Evans, Tim Henman, Cameron Norrie and Joe Salisbury). Photograph: Jaimi Chisholm/Getty Images   The event is going to play a pioneering role in innovation in our sport, Hutchins said, as James Ward arrived to replace the rehabbing Murray. It has, he added, given the ATP a chance to introduce [new] rules, technology, behind-the-scenes access, event production and more. The ATP Cup is set to shine a new and unique light on our sport. It will bring the fans and players closer together, and on a much bigger scale, than weve seen before in tennis. Among the new bells and whistles will be the games quickfire and hopefully less controversial version of VAR, a video review operating courtside to sort out double bounces, foul shots, touches or invasion. Teams will occupy corners of stadiums, rather than sitting along either side of the umpire, and will be armed with an array of technology and statistics to aid on-court coaching.   Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors picks.  The group stages will be played over the first six days and the tournament will then move to Sydney for a four-day knockout in the final eight, before everyone heads for Melbourne and the Australian Open on 20 January, a caravan of millionaires, as ever, unsure of their final destination. In an optimistic twist, there will be a new canopy over the Ken Rosewall Arena in Sydney, which will host Britains group stage as well as the final. If ever there was an appropriate time for the heavens to rain on a parade, it surely is in the tinder-dry settings of fire-ravaged NSW. Hutchins, meanwhile, will hope that a new audience can see through the lingering smoke to embrace a project designed to bring clarity to a sport wandering still through its own self-induced haze.","771"

And, lets face it, there are always good reasons not to lock your money away  confusion over different accounts, fear of making the wrong choice, or feeling as though you dont have enough money to make it worthwhile can all outweigh the best intentions. But, as the NHSs Couch to 5K programme taught us about exercise, things are a lot less overwhelming if you start small and build up. It is never too late  or too early  to start Dont worry if you have been putting it off for years  you cant be too old to start saving. Whatever your age, you need to decide that saving is something you want, or need, to do, says Iona Bain, the founder of the blog Young Money. After all, she points out, saving is only possible with motivation. If you are struggling to feel driven, she has advice: Saving gives you choices in the future. Once you start understanding that its still your money, just put somewhere safe in case you need it, you start finding that motivation that will make saving much easier. Clear the decks Dont start a savings account if you have expensive debt to pay off  you will be better off clearing an overdraft or credit card, as they charge higher interest rates than you can earn. But once these debts are cleared, you can start to think about building a nest egg. One option is to set up a monthly standing order to pay into a savings account just after you have been paid. The logic here is that if you cannot see the money in your current account you will not spend it. This is a good choice if you know how much you can afford to save each month. If you dont, you can squirrel away money throughout the month using a round-up feature. Offered by the new online banks, including Revolut, Starling and Monzo, as well as Lloyds TSB and Halifax, these let you round up any spending to the nearest 1 and put the difference into a savings pot. So, if you spend 1.45, you will be debited 2, of which 55p will be squirrelled away. Monzo lets you transfer to an interest-earning account once you have at least 10, while Starling pays up to 0.5% on all balances. Lloyds and Halifax give you a choice of accounts. Alternatively, you could wait until the end of the month and sweep what is left in your current account into your savings. You can do this with any bank, but First Directs 1st account can be set up to do this automatically. Have a goal As with Couch to 5K, it can be helpful to have a goal. Small, short-term targets are good at first, because they are achievable and will get you into good habits. It might be tickets for a show or an activity you have wanted to see for a long time, a new pair of jeans or a night away. Whatever it is, work out how much you need and when you need it. Once you have achieved your aim, do not close your account. You are in the habit now, so keep going. Bain says not to worry too much about savings rates at this point, but if you want an extra incentive, a website such as Savings Champion will show you the best-paying accounts. If you want to be able to withdraw your money in the next year, take a look at easy-access accounts. Think long term If you are saving for a property, think about using a Lifetime Isa. If you want to save for the long term, start exploring pensions and other investments. Some of these have minimum payment levels as low as 1, although small investments may disappear in fees, so you will need more to make it worthwhile  25 a month is more typical and meaningful. If you are investing over a short time period, certainly fewer than five years, then you should stick with cash, even though interest rates are currently at very low levels, says Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner at the advice firm Chase de Vere. This is because, if you invest in the stock market and it falls in value, you will have very little time to claw back any losses. A good starting place if you have a small sum and do not want to take much risk is a fund that tracks the UK stock market. The Money Advice Service, an independent body set up by the government, has a useful guide on how to buy investments, with links to sites where you can research potential purchases.","800"

Like a pig sniffing for truffles, I am going to hunt out humour and hope in the new year, and plan to reread Douglas Adamss Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy quartet, which I havent done since I was a teenager. I have been told that Mr Fox by Helen Oyeyemi is very funny, so I will get that too. I also want to read Pablo Nerudas Odes to Common Things as I am a fan of Neruda and have never read it. It is about the pleasure we can take in everyday items in the world around us, from soap to tomatoes, and I am thinking it will be the perfect antidote to all the big-picture worrying the world is encouraging us to do. I feel a lot of us need to reconnect with the immediacy of the world around us, and so I will seek out books like this, in order to stay (relatively) hopeful about life. That said, I will also be pre-ordering The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, which will be a must-read for anyone interested in the politics and practicalities of the next stages for the environmental movement. Figueres was the public face of the Paris climate agreement and knows better than anyone the political landscape of environmentalism so it should be essential reading. Matt Haigs Notes on a Nervous Planet is published by Canongate. Cressida Cowell    I dont have reading resolutions, because its reading for the joy of it thats important  both for children and for adults. This is top of my Childrens Laureate Charter: if reading feels enforced then we know from academic studies that we dont get the same benefits. Enjoyment is the key. But I am looking forward to reading Maggie OFarrells Hamnet, because her writing is wonderful, and I adore Shakespeare. Akalas first book for young adults, The Dark Lady, sounds intriguing. Its an adventure story set in Elizabethan England, and I love the idea that reading is a superpower. If you havent read Onjali Rafs The Boy at the Back of the Class, its a great choice for new year optimism  a brilliant book for encouraging empathy. The school holidays can be a great time to reset if you are struggling to get your children into books. Reading together beyond the age your kids can read for themselves can be an incredible tool  it sends a message that books are important, because they can make my mum laugh or my dad cry. Just 10 minutes a day can make a difference. I remember every book read aloud to me in an adults voice. Cressida Cowells Emily Brown and Father Christmas is published by Hodder. David Olusoga    Next year Im making a documentary about African literature for the BBC, so Im looking forward to rereading novels I first read as a teenager: Buchi Emechetas Second Class Citizen, Ayi Kwei Armahs The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born, Chinua Achebes Things Fall Apart and Weep Not, Child by Ngg wa Thiongo. My own writing is non-fiction, so my pile of books to read in 2020 is dominated by history titles. At the very top is William Dalrymples acclaimed The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company. When I get a holiday Im planning to read We by the Russian novelist Yevgeny Zamyatin. Reading Dan Jacksons The Northumbrians, I was reminded that Zamyatin had based aspects of the dystopian future society he creates in that novel on my home town of Newcastle, where he spent time during the first world war. As a historian the one genre I never allow myself to read is historical fiction. But I gleefully break that rule when a new Hilary Mantel novel comes out. So like a lot of people I am counting down the days to the publication of The Mirror and the Light, the final book in the astonishing Wolf Hall trilogy. David Olusogas Civilisations: First Contact/The Cult of Progress is published by Profile. Patrice Lawrence    Next year, I need books to remind me how funny, compassionate, resilient and lyrical my fellow human beings can be. First, I want funny. Percival Everetts I Am Not Sidney Poitier will bring me that. Its hero, Not Sidney Poitier, was delivered after a 24-month pregnancy following an immaculate conception. I think Im going to like him. Next, back to my lifes work of sussing out my Trinidadian side. Ill be sucking up the beautiful prose of Trini writers Anthony Joseph and Monique Roffey. Josephs The Frequency of Magic is about a butcher who has been writing his novel for 41 years but distractions are aplenty. The cast of Roffeys The Mermaid of Black Conch includes a mermaid, a fisherman, an artist and a benevolent white landowner. I am a sucker for London books. Kamala Markandayas The Nowhere Man is a tough but necessary read. Set in 1968, the year of Enoch Powells rivers of blood speech, it is about an elderly Indian widower befriended by an English woman, until their life is shattered by racist violence. On a completely different note, I am shamefully excited about False Value, the next book in Ben Aaronovitchs fantasy series Rivers of London, out in February. Finally, Ill be diving in and out of the African American poet and activist June Jordans Civil Wars: Observations from the Front Lines of America. Because. Patrice Lawrences Rose, Interrupted is published by Hodder. Jenny Colgan    I am looking for jollity in 2020. If Craig Browns One Two Three Four: The Beatles in Time is half as brilliant, gossipy and revealing as his book about Princess Margaret, I will be delighted. I am truly hoping that the new television series based on All Creatures Great and Small will reawaken Britains love for James Herriot. I have never lost it, but he seems to have rather fallen out of fashion, which is a shame as I find his gentle, funny stories a balm in difficult times. Although it sounds strange, Im also looking forward to reading a novel in the form of a journal by the only woman to survive a massacre by Bigfoot. Devolution is by Max Brooks, who wrote the stone cold classic that is World War Z, so I will follow him pretty much anywhere. Few things are pleasanter to read when cosy in bed than utterly dreadful dystopian things happening to somebody else. Pleasingly, Bim Adewunmi and Nichole Perkins are bringing out The Chrises, about who is the best: Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pine or Chris Evans. The frankly deranged level of detail this is going to have to go into to fill a whole book makes me think it will be impossible to read without being cheered up: the very idea of it is cheering me up right now (Hemsworth, durr). And finally, if we get Neil Gaimans mooted sequel to Neverwhere in 2020, well, that cannot fail to lift the spirits. Every time I take a DLR train out into east London I think of what he could do with Gallions Reach and Pontoon Dock, and I absolutely cannot wait. Jenny Colgans An Island Christmas is published by Sphere. Elif Shafak    When politics get depressing, its time to turn to books for refuge. I love novels of ideas, the big canvas that gently helps us to shift our cognitive angle. The characters, the connections, and above all the voice. Literature takes us out of our own mental ghettoes and comfort zones, and we urgently need that now. This year I am planning to read more female writers. From different corners of the world. No country is the centre of the world, no country is exceptional, and reading novels will help us to see that better. I am interested in books that take risks, challenge our basic assumptions about life and ourselves and, especially, the other. It is also always worthwhile visiting or revisiting the classics for a dose of sanity. Victor Hugo or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or Ivan Turgenev have a lot to say about our own strange times. I usually read fiction and non-fiction simultaneously. Political philosophers can help us to refuel ourselves. Hannah Arendt, Isaiah Berlin, Zygmunt Bauman, Bertrand Russell  This year I will be judging the George Orwell prize and I am looking forward to the pile of non-fiction in front of us. I also love reading comics. Graphic novels that dance a waltz with either the past or the future are the best in times of crisis. Elif Shafaks 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World is published by Penguin. Damian Barr    Its very easy to retreat into nostalgia, to hide in the past. I want my new years reading to be diverting, inspiring and empowering. Thats what I think well need a balance of in 2020, because its going to be a challenging year, and reading is an act of resistance. I like a diverting read, and Ive got a very nice boxed set of EF Bensons Mapp and Lucia novels. Although theyre frothy, theres an interesting subtext in there to do with class. Inspiring for me will be a book I reread every few years: The Color Purple by Alice Walker. I think if Celie can get through her life in that society, then I can get through anything. And I would like to read Your Silence Will Not Protect You by Audre Lorde, which Ive seen quoted in lots of places but have not read myself. Ill also be rereading Richard Holloways On Forgiveness. Hes the retired bishop of Edinburgh and writes persuasively and powerfully about our need to forgive ourselves in order to forgive others, and how what were forgiving is people, not deeds. It humanises, and one of the things that worries me about the year were going into is that politics is seeking to dehumanise and other people. So in that regard its hopeful. And Im looking forward to We Have Always Been Here by Samra Habib, her memoir of being queer and female. Shes an Ahmadi Muslim and its about her journey to find and accept herself. I want to read stories where people are pulling through, where people are resisting, even if thats a small act of resistance. Damian Barrs You Will Be Safe Here is published by Bloomsbury. Gina Miller    I am going to have a holiday, which is quite unusual, and my three books are already packed. I didnt want them to be too heavy  after everything, I want to read things that will make me smile. So firstly Im going to reread A Tale of Two Cities, which I think probably has some parallels with today about the best of times, the worst of times.   Related: Best books of 2019   Next in my suitcase is The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. Its one of those books I like to read when I can really enjoy it, almost eat the words  I call it a delicious book. I love the series, but all Alexander McCall Smith books are lovely to read. The third, which I havent read before, but so many people have told me about, is Bill Brysons A Walk in the Woods. When I was a free climber, it took me to a different place and perspective, because I had to concentrate on climbing, and thats what Im hoping this book will do. I love the thought of it being a conversation with a friend  walking and friendship and the Appalachian Trail.

Their goal was to offset a housing shortage, but the plan was unwelcome news to many community members: theyd been rallying to turn the long-vacant space into a community garden.    A map of the original city and game. Photograph: AG Spielumwelt / NGBK, 1970/71   At a town hall meeting, they were livid. You only want to make money, one person called out to the landowner. Another grabbed the microphone and yelled, We want a new mayor! The room broke into cheers. This scene of municipal discontent, not unfamiliar in public hearings the world over, played out among a group of 13- and 14-year-old Berlin students. Their town hall was the back corner of an art gallery, and the plywood city they were furiously debating was the setting for an urban role-playing game. Built as a microcosm of Berlin (and, really, most cities), it features a town hall, a cafe, a bank, housing, and a late-night corner shop. The participating students are each given roles  deal-making mayor, out-of-work bus driver, police officer, activist, landowner  and a set of issues to address, including rising rents, thefts, drug dealing, well-paid jobs and unemployment. The model city, and the game, recreates a project that ran in Berlin from 1969-72 in which kids created a small model city and operated mock shops, school spaces and civic institutions. This new iteration, organised by the arts organisation nGbK, aims to give kids a chance to play the roles of the varied actors of city life, but also to build a testbed for ideas to address real urban challenges.    Some of the mock shops and city spaces from the 2019 game. Photograph: AG Spielclub   The thing we wanted to do was to focus on the capitalisation of cities, with the question what happens when the houses are for money-making instead of for living in, says Claudia Hummel, one of the projects coordinators. Played in rounds, the game quickly becomes tense. Students playing the landlord role collect rent from the other participants  and just as in real life, as rents rise, some of the tenants struggle to afford their apartments. One game with a class of 7- and 8-year-olds led to anxiety, says Heather Purcell, one of the game guides. Thats very stressful for them. The rent feels like a real problem. So you can see them experience it and they come to you like, What do I do with this problem? she says. For kids with little, if any, experience of real money, financial strain led to some interesting responses. When one student playing a nurse faced eviction, better-paid workers decided to pool their money to pay for everyones rent together. Often, if theyre working with their friends, they think of a collective solution, Purcell says. I think kids come to that quicker than grown-ups.    Development plans for a piece of vacant ground quickly became controversial in the 2019 game. Photograph: AG Spielclub   Could the responses offer lessons for adults in real cities? The group upset about losing their community garden site decided their solution should be political. They called new elections and held a hustings. One candidate declared herself a member of the Green party and pledged to plant more trees. A group of boys proposed creating equal rights for everyone in the city  women also, one clarified  and offered supporters 10 per vote. A third candidate, wearing a Napoleonic bicorne hat, said he wanted to rid the city of drug dealers and thieves. Every candidate vowed to lower rents. Almost every kid in Berlin knows this experience of rising rents from their families. They understand the problem, says Ann-Christin Janzen, the students teacher.   Related: Kids and the city: how do you build the perfect space for children?   The tough-on-crime candidate prevailed. As for the landowner, she told the new mayor she would make her proposed apartments available to anyone working for a charity. But by then the citizens had scattered, and other concerns had arisen. The operators of the cafe were opening a second location; the newspaper editor was writing up the election results; the police officer was back on the beat. Life in the city kept turning.

"2020-01-01T10:00:02Z","books","Books","Top 10 books about new beginnings","The other night I dreamed it was my last day of high school. I was gathering schoolbooks when something caught my eye: lettuce leaves, lying on the carpet. Perfect! I thought, scooping them up and packing them. Now I wont be hungry at university next year! I woke still glowing with pride. Since that dream, Ive been thinking about how neatly education arranges life into endings and beginnings. You finish one segment, take a summer holiday, and step into the next  nervous, excited  and equipped, if you have my sort of foresight, with a handful of rotting lettuce leaves. But grownup life is more chaotic. There are plenty of potential beginnings  jobs, partners, dietary changes, but nobody has drawn up a schedule. Changes tend to be flung at you, or depend on your own efforts. In my novel Gravity Is the Thing, changes are both flung at and chosen by Abigail, owner-manager of the Happiness Cafe. Back when she was a teenager, Abigails brother vanished. Around the same time, she started receiving chapters in the mail from a self-help book called The Guidebook. Now, 20 years later, shes invited to a retreat to learn the truth about The Guidebook. The absence of Abigails brother is central to her story. A missing loved one is a particularly traumatic loss because it isnt entirely a loss. At any moment, the person could reappear. Theres no ending, so there cant be a new beginning: life without the loved one cannot start. In Gravity, I wanted to explore the promises of the self-help industry in this context of ambiguous loss: much like hope, self-help can be both transformative and destructive. At first, the idea of choosing 10 books about new beginnings alarmed me. I couldnt think of any. Then I realised that all novels have at least one crisis, discovery or transformation, and each of these triggers new beginnings. Essentially, then, this is a list of books that have been special to me (not the most special, those would be the books of my sisters, Liane and Nicola) or that have shaped me as a writer or person, angled to catch the light. 1. Cocaine Blues by Kerry GreenwoodPhryne Fisher, sexy, sassy and newly arrived in Melbourne, Australia, decides to become a private detective. This is the first in a series that is pure, witty, intelligent escapism, each book improving on the one before. I read these in the bath, with chocolate, whenever Im worried or sad, and everything is instantly better.    Exuberant prose  Kate Atkinson. Photograph: Helen Clyne   2. Case Histories by Kate AtkinsonIn his own way, Jackson Brodie is just as charismatic, sexy and capable as Phryne Fisher. Case Histories, the first of Brodies stories, has him embarking on his new career as private detective. I read this many years ago, on a train between Toronto and Montreal, just after a miscarriage, and cried at almost every page. It was exactly what I needed. I already admired Kate Atkinson, but this was when I fell in love with her exuberant, powerful prose. 3. In the Mood by Laura BloomSet in Sydney in 1946, In the Mood depicts a young couple attempting to restart their marriage after the husbands return from war. Blooms writing is exquisite, and her meticulous dissection of a relationship frayed by secrets and trauma is reminiscent of Henry James (without the excessive sub-clauses). Ive always been drawn to novels like this that take the domestic sphere as seriously as it deserves. 4. Lennys Book of Everything by Karen FoxleeEveryone should read this childrens book set in the 1970s. Lennys brother, Davy, was born six days after Neil Armstrong took his famous step and everyone was still crazy with moon fever. But Lennys mother has a dark heart feeling about Davy, a feeling as big as the sky kept inside a thimble. Davy begins to grow, and does not stop, and so begin years of doctor and hospital visits, worry and hope. The kindness of neighbours, the distraction of Burrells Build-It-at-Home Encyclopaedia, Davys winning charm and Lennys determination, complete an immersive tale about loss and its transformative powers. It will make you sob.    Poetic, sharp, original  Lorrie Moore. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian   5. Self-Help by Lorrie MooreMost of the stories in this collection explore new beginnings of different kinds: how to become the other woman, how to be the child of newly divorced parents. In the succinctly titled How, we learn how to start a doomed love affair: Begin by meeting him in a class, in a bar, at a rummage sale. Moores prose is poetic, sharp and devastatingly funny. Just when you think theres nothing new to say about relationships, Moore cracks open a fresh layer and confounds you with her insight. 6. Chrestomanci by Diana Wynne JonesI usually write for young people so I often read childrens books. My favourites are funny, emotionally authentic and contain practical magic. Wynne Joness books, like those of Ellen Raskin and Sally Gardner, make my soul breathe a sigh of relief. The Chrestomanci books are set in parallel worlds to ours, and feature protagonists discovering their magical abilities and setting out to develop them. The charming Christopher Chant appears just in time, offering elegant solutions to seemingly intractable problems. 7. Dear Mrs Bird by AJ PearceA comic delight of a tale about friendship and love set against the grim landscape of London during the blitz, this novel sensitively conveys how life, even in tragedy and heartbreak, can be humorous and hopeful. Emmeline Lake accidentally takes a new job typing up letters for an advice columnist at a womens magazine in London, 1941, which rules an extensive range of subjects out of bounds. Defying her instructions, Emmeline begins to answer them herself. 8. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail HoneymanI read this novel on an aeroplane and it made me laugh often and cry more. Eleanor, nearly 30, has been leading a precise, guarded and solitary life, holding herself together through addiction and routine. Then a singer walks on to a stage, and Eleanor falls instantly in love: He blazed  I sat forward on my seat, edged closer. At last. Id found him. A marvel of humour and heartbreak, Eleanor Oliphant reveals how a new friendship can begin to unravel the traumas that are knotted deep within us.

This is an eviscerating study of the beginnings of Australian colonialism. It collects compelling evidence that Indigenous Australians were not, as the prevailing historical narrative maintains  and as required by the law of terra nullius  wandering hunter gatherers, but had established both agriculture and dwellings. 10. The Waves by Virginia WoolfThis novel opens with a group of children starting out on their life journeys, and has them guide us through to their old age and death in six exquisite, first-person accounts. I read it in high school and it was my first encounter with language so intensely beautiful. It is lyrical, inventive, self-referential and determined to excavate relentlessly in pursuit of truth.  Gravity Is the Thing by Jaclyn Moriarty is published by Allen & Unwin.","1186"

Given her seamless upward trajectory and personality it would take a brave person to argue with his lordship. Last autumn the 24-year-old won three world championship medals, including the 200m title, making her the greatest British female sprinter in history. Next year she will have live chances of Olympic gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay  although Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shaunae Miller-Uibo and the USA 4x100m team will have a thing or two (or three) to say about that. Sean Ingle Kelsey-Lee BarberAustraliaAthletics, Javelin Barbers seasonal best chart over the past decade shows almost linear improvement. The 28-year-old javelin thrower finished 20th at the 2015 world championships, 10th two years later and upset a talented field last September to clinch gold. Barber is no stranger to high-pressure competition, having won medals at consecutive Commonwealth Games and competed in Rio, but Tokyo will be her first outing as the athlete to beat. Following several retirements, Barber and the high-jumper Brandon Starc are Australias only established medal hopes in track and field.

She will enter Tokyo as a runaway favourite to become the oldest woman in more than five decades to win the Olympic all-around title, the sports most coveted prize, and the first repeat champion since Vera Caslavska did it for the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. As ever, her only competition is herself. Bryan Armen Graham Sky BrownGreat BritainSkateboarding If Brown qualifies for Tokyo  and she is almost a shoo-in  she will be only 12 years and 15 days on the opening day of skateboarding, eclipsing the swimmer Margery Hinton to become the youngest British athlete to ever compete at an Olympics. Brown, who was born in Japan to an English father and Japanese mother, is improving at such a rate it is impossible to put limits on where she might finish  in September she was third in the So Paulo Park World Championships. SI    Sky Brown is set to become the youngest ever British Olympian. Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian   Christian ColemanUSAAthletics, 100m The soft-spoken 23-year-old from Atlanta has, over the past three seasons, established himself as the warm favourite to succeed Usain Bolt as the Olympic 100m champion, most recently in September when he surged to the world title in a personal-best time of 9.76sec that made him the sixth-fastest man in history. His reputation took a hit when the US Anti-Doping Agency charged him with three whereabouts failures in a 12-month period  an offence that carries a potential two-year ban  but a defiant Coleman has kept on course for a Tokyo coronation after the case was dropped. BAG Rohan DennisAustraliaRoad Cycling A mercurial cyclist specialising in the race against the clock, Dennis, 29, raised eyebrows when he walked out on his WorldTour team Bahrain Merida midway through the Tour de France. While he has not ridden for them since, and is currently in a contractual dispute, that did not stop Dennis from defending his world time trial crown in September. Having recently signed with Ineos, who seem agreeable to Dennis focusing on the Olympics, the South Australian is a strong favourite for time trial gold. KP    Rohan Dennis should get backing from Team Ineos to focus on the Olympics. Photograph: Manu Fernndez/AP   Caeleb Dressel USASwimming The 23-year-old from Florida has been cast as the heir to Michael Phelps as the face of swimming in the US and, potentially, the world. The freestyle, breaststroke and butterfly sprint specialist equalled Phelpss world championships record with seven gold medals in Budapest two years ago, followed by six golds and two silvers at last years worlds in Gwangju. Dressel has played down suggestions he would add the 4x200m free relay to his Tokyo schedule  and make a run at Phelpss epochal eight-gold haul from Beijing 2008  but even so seven golds remain in his sights. BAG Janja GarnbretSloveniaSport climbing Climbing will be one of the starry new attractions at Tokyo 2020  and Garnbret is expected to shine brightest of all. The 20-year-old has been described as a reincarnated spider monkey because of her ability to scale walls and in 2019 she become the first athlete to win every bouldering World Cup event in a season. She won the world titles in bouldering and combined climbing in 2018 and 2019 and is also rapidly improving in her weakest discipline, speed climbing, making her heavy favourite for Olympic gold.

The perennially consistent Gilmore, 31, won the 2018 World Surf League and finished fourth last year. If she can overcome the likes of Fitzgibbons and the Hawaiian Carissa Moore, the natural-footer will have a real shot at gold. It would be a fitting triumph, given Gilmore and her countrys consistent surfing success over the past decade. KP Nyjah HustonUSASkateboarding Skateboarding debuts as a medal event in Tokyo and the three-times world champion from Laguna Beach is widely regarded as the gold medal favourite in mens street. The 25-year-old is a long-established star in the skate world, having amassed more than 3.7 million Instagram followers, a signature Nike shoe and more prize money than any other skateboarder in history since making his X Games debut aged 11.

British Cycling insiders say that three more could arrive in Tokyo in the team pursuit, omnium and, if selected, madison. Seven Olympic golds would take Kenny to the top of the Team GB medal pantheon, above her fellow track cyclists Sir Chris Hoy and her husband Jason, who both have six golds and a silver. However, with Jason also gunning for more glory in Tokyo it could yet be Kenny v Kenny for the title of the top Team GB athlete in history. SI    Laura Kenny on her way to glory in the omnium in Rio.

She will go to Tokyo desperate to right that wrong, even if she ends up wearing the vest of a neutral athlete given Russias recent four-year ban.

Many expect McCormack, a classy light-welterweight who has won Commonwealth and European Games titles, to follow in their gold-laced footsteps. Last year he reached the final of the world championships, only to lose to the Russian Andrey Zamkovoy. But with question marks over Russias participation, he could go off as favourite in Tokyo.

Masse, who has been tipped to become her countrys first Olympic backstroke champion since Mark Tewksbury in 1992, will headline a Canadian team including Penny Oleksiak, Maggie MacNeil, Taylor Ruck and Sydney Pickrem that will enter Tokyo with medal chances up and down the programme. BAG Shaunae Miller-UiboBahamasAthletics Remember Michael Johnson winning 200m and 400m gold at Atlanta? Well, 24 years on, Miller-Uibo has a live chance of repeating Johnsons extraordinary feat. Not only is she the reigning 400m Olympic champion, she was also the fastest over 200m in 2019  beating Dina Asher-Smith easily when they met. However, the schedule might yet thwart her in Tokyo. As things stand she would have to run a 400m heat on the morning before trying to win gold in the 200m final in the evening. Yet dont bet against it being Miller-Uibo time in 2020. SI    Shaunae Miller-Uibo could emulate the great Michael Johnson on the track. Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reuters   Naomi OsakaJapanTennis Osaka has had an up and down 2019 but she is still the reigning Australian Open champion and ranked No 3 in the world. And crucially, her decision in October to represent the country of her birth, Japan, rather than the US  a country where she has dual citizenship  means she will be one of the stories of the Games. It is a special feeling to aim for the Olympics as a representative of Japan, she said recently. I think that playing with the pride of the country will make me feel more emotional. SI Teddy RinerFranceJudo Japan might have invented judo, but no one has dominated the sport more than Big Teddy Riner. The 6ft 8in and 20st Frenchman not only has two Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016 to his name, along with a bronze in Beijing as a teenager in 2008, but has won a record 10 world titles. The last time he was beaten? September 2010. If the Frenchman takes gold again he will join Tadahiro Nomura on three Olympic titles  and the ominous news for his rivals is that he intends he continue until Paris 2024.

But dont forget Scott. Not only did he anchor Britain to 4x100m relay gold at last years world championships and win bronze in the 200m freestyle, he also made global headlines by refusing to shake hands with the controversial Chinese swimmer Sun Yang. If Yang survives his doping case, the rematch in Tokyo will be tasty. SI Ariarne TitmusAustraliaSwimming Australian swimming has been in the doldrums, but the wonderkid Titmus is determined to propel them back up the medal table in Tokyo. The teenager spectacularly beat Katie Ledecky in the 400m freestyle at the world championships in 2019, in an event in which the American superstar had been undefeated since 2012. The rematch should be thrilling, and Titmus is also a strong contender in the 200m, 800m and relays. After winning three golds and a silver at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, the Tasmanian will hope for an even more bountiful haul. KP","1890"

And I still have no idea who I am. For a while, Hollywood wasnt sure either. She was the supportive romcom friend in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, the sex-crazed wife in Step Brothers and the dutiful mum in The Visit, stealing scenes whenever she could  but always playing a woman defined by someone else. I was burning for bigger opportunities, she says, in a meeting room in HBOs new Manhattan office. But I never thought they would happen. I never thought I would be seen as the lead. I always felt like an outsider. Having scored the lead role in HBOs riotous new comedy series, Mrs Fletcher, its clear that Hahn is firmly on the inside. But even now, shes keen to keep herself firmly grounded. I dont usually dress like this for an interview, she says, explaining that her pristine, all-white get-up is for an on stage panel appearance shes heading to next. No offence, she adds. Im usually a sweatpants kind of gal. Shes eager to take off her shoes but asks first, worrying it might seem tacky.    Mrs Fletcher, based on the book by Tom Perrotta, is a dual coming of age story: high-school jock Brendan is dealing with the horror of life as a nobody at college, while his divorced mother Hahn is grappling with an empty nest. I responded to her sense of hunger, says Hahn. That overwhelming sense of existential loneliness for this woman who had given so much of herself. She tried to play by the rules, did everything she was asked, tried to be the good girl her whole life. Then finally she was left with What now? The answer is an explosive sexual reawakening fuelled by an increasing obsession with pornography. Its this Pandoras box, says Hahn. Once she starts to dive in, the interesting stuff to her is the stuff shed never really allowed herself to investigate, never thought she could, or didnt think she was allowed to, which just breaks my heart.    Crowd-pleasing  Hahn with Mila Kunis, left, and Kristen Bell in Bad Moms. Photograph: Michele K. Short/AP   This leads Eve down some X-rated alleys: masturbating on the floor to porn, spanking herself over the kitchen counter and having sex with a stranger, all of which echoes her character Carla in the Bad Moms franchise, a crowd-pleasing hurricane of filth. As is now standard for HBO, there was an intimacy coordinator present during the shooting of many risque scenes, while the fact that the shows directors were all female made for a different atmosphere on set. Of course youre going to be nervous, says Hahn, but at least I felt heard and safe. Porn in Mrs Fletcher is used not just to show how much Eve can learn about herself but also to show how much Brendans view of sex and of women has been warped by what hes seen online. Its a problem that concerns Hahn in real life. If the sex youre seeing is gagging, choking and violence, thats not real. And if no one is there to say this, its a tricky conundrum.   I try to have courage, even if I am politely declined for my opinion, I will always give it because I think its important   This is a whole new terrifying world to Hahn. As a mother of two, the internet is a constant cause of angst. She tells me about unintentionally watching a YouTube video of some cute bunny footage with her daughter, who was one, when it suddenly cut to a guy masturbating. She has also been forced to have a chat with her 13-year-old son, concerned about the screen grabs or clips he might find online. I said: You cant Google me, please dont Google my name. One day Im going to be able to explain my choices to him because Im proud of them but hes too young to understand them yet. Hahn always knew she was going to be an actor (but not, shes quick to point out, a star). She never considered another option. In college, her friends were the dumb chain-smoking idiots she acted with on stage. And, as part of the theatre crowd, she deftly avoided the sort of entitled white kid status embodied by her son in Mrs Fletcher. But she has encountered this type since, in moving to Hollywood  the bully who has never had to contend with not getting his own way. She describes herself as bullish on the set of the show, though, and collaborated so closely with Perrotta on her character that she ultimately asked for  and was given  a producer credit.    Speaking up ... Kathryn Hahn. Photograph: Ali Smith for The Guardian   I try to have courage, she says. Even if I am politely declined for my opinion, I will always give it because I think its important. If I am swallowing it, I will drive home at the end of the day pissed at myself. Not only has she learned to speak up, she has also found a way of bringing perspective to any feelings of anger. Im angry every time I look at the news, of course, she says. I have so much rage but Im also the mother of two children and life is so short. I feel like anger is so freezing. It can either galvanise you or it can freeze you. Given that she has talked in the past of her feelings of anxiety, I wonder how she deals with negative feelings? Besides copious amounts of marijuana? Im kidding! Am I? No, Im kidding. I cant do it that often, honey, Im a mother! Its the same for having a drink: she says she feels resentful when she sees people who have the time to take things easy. We walk by people reading the New York Times with brunch on a Sunday and I want to be like: Fuck you, who has time to do that any more? She laughs. Look at you people with your spread-out New York Times, having mimosas. Hahn believes we are currently in a really galvanising moment for women and shes thrilled to be heading to the world of Marvel next, starring in the series WandaVision alongside Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany. This is such a crazy time in a womans life hormonally, she says. Its a whole different ballgame, a thrilling and terrifying trip. Everyone tells you the lights are starting to fade but its like, no, you still have so much beautiful life yet.","1053"
"2020-01-01T09:01:00Z","books","Books","The Power of Bad and How to Overcome It review – professional Pollyannas","Without wishing to sound too Prince Andrew about this, there are hotels in New York where I wont stay. One is called the Casablanca, and is extolled in this book as a fine example of how to stick it to the power of bad. By bad, the authors dont mean moral or aesthetic bad, but what they call negativity bias. That bias means an unfortunate impression outweighs a good one; a financial loss is more painful than an equivalent gain; and that a hotels many five-star reviews on TripAdvisor have no clout over potential customers who have read the single one-star review  particularly if it mentions rats droppings in the bed. Something had to be done against this online bias. And so the Casablanca launched a charm offensive. If you manage to connect with every single guest, youve given yourself an insurance policy against bad reviews because theyre unlikely to say something negative about someone whos their friend, argued the hotels Adele Gutman, who initiated a policy of what she calls sparkling sunshine. John Tierney and Roy F Baumeister eulogise this offensive: From the doorman to the bellhop everyone is supposed to beam  Welcome to our hotel  and treat the guests arrival as a singularly delightful treat: This is your first time in New York? Were going to have fun with you! The favourite part of our job is helping people make the most of New York! Maybe Im overcome by negativity bias but just kill me now. The bellhop studies how you react to seeing your room and reports back to central control, who offer you a new suite if youve disclosed disappointment. Every evening there is free wine and cheese in the lounge so staff can take your spiritual temperature, learn of your every hitherto unexpressed whim and satisfy it. If, presumably, its legal. The hotels replies to online reviews are often longer than the reviews themselves. This minimises the risk of one-star reviews by obeying psychologys peak-end rule, which is to leave customers thinking that even if their stay was all blocked toilets and cold showers, at least the staff seemed to care. Were devastated to hear that you did not enjoy your one-night stay with us, went the Casablancas reply to a one-star review complaining about street noise. The result? The Casablanca has conquered bad. It has had a five-star ranking on TripAdvisor for more than a decade. Even so, Id rather stay in Fawlty Towers than be haunted by irrepressible extrovert staff sparkling non-stop sunshine during my stay and nice-trolling me online. What Tierney and Baumeister dont realise is that there is not just a power of bad but a curse of good too. Thats the sequel right there. But they would be ill-equipped to write it since they are professional Pollyannas who have read too little Adorno and listened to too much Bing Crosby, so they accentuate the positive to the point of complacency. We really are living in a golden age, they write, even if most people believe otherwise. Elsewhere they add: We are richer, healthier, freer and safer than our ancestors could have ever hoped to be, yet we dont enjoy our blessings. The Great Enrichment continues and it will proceed even faster if we can overcome the real crisis by learning to ignore the fearmongers. Walter Benjamin wrote of the angel of history moving backwards into the future with debris piling up around his feet, eyes on the ruin of the past. Tierney and Baumeister dont roll that way. Ignore the debris and the naysayers. Keep your eyes on the prize. Only Cassandras like me doubt there is a prize. Clearly I need to cultivate a positivity bias. But how? The authors have an idea. Each Thanksgiving, diners should write down things they are grateful for on a tablecloth. The effect gets stronger every Thanksgiving that you reuse the tablecloth and it makes for good reading the rest of the year too. Im grateful for every Thanksgiving I dont spend counting my blessings with Tierney and Baumeister. If their cure to me seems worse than the disease, they are at least astute at diagnosis. The adaptive traits that served our ancestral hunter-gatherers on the savannah hobble us in the 21st century. Those of our ancestors who survived sensibly focused more on avoiding poisonous berries rather than finding the delicious ones. Today weve become Chicken Littles, so irrationally fearing that the sky will fall that we hurry into the Foxs lair where, ironically, we get murdered. The authors capitalise Fox in making this point, and I hoped they were subtly indicting Trumps favourite news medium. One reason, after all, for the power of bad is what they call the crisis industry of journalists, politicians and social media blowhards. Consider terrorism: Randomly murdering a few innocent civilians was strategically pointless until the late 19th century. Only then, as the telegraph and the cheap printing presses began quickly spreading news, did terrorists discover the power of a single horrendous act. Yet like several reactionary, improbably upbeat analyses of current politics in the book, this perspective serves neocon values. It wasnt scaremongering hacks who created Isis; invading Iraq had something to do with it. No matter. The crisis industry makes us worry about jihadists when we should be more concerned about bathtubs. Those killed worldwide by Al Qaeda and Isis is fewer than the number of Americans who died in their baths, Tierney and Baumeister contend. The irrational negativity bias explains how, as they put it, countries blunder into disastrous wars, why neighbours feud and couples divorce, how economies stagnate, why applicants flub job interviews, how schools are failing pupils. And why American taxpayers bankroll spiralling defence expenditure instead of spending a few bucks on non-slip bath mats. For the authors, our task is to use innovative rational thought to stop such flubbing, stagnating and blundering. They chart in engaging detail how Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgarten overcame his (quite understandable) negative thoughts about plummeting to death from space by means of cognitive behavioural therapeutic techniques such as repeating mantras and deep breathing. As a result, he acquired the power of positive jumping, falling from a helium balloon in the stratosphere in 2012, reaching 843.6 mph before he touched down in New Mexico 24 miles and four minutes 19 seconds later. Good for Felix: hell never be my role model. The authors believe we shouldnt eliminate the negative but harness it for good. They rip into the 1970s self-esteem movement that was devised to thwart the power of bad but that led, they claim, to schools ringfencing students from failure. Its nuts, they argue, for alienated schoolboys to be chided for playing violent video games. Why? Because being killed online and forced to begin again better prepares them for overcoming failure in the real world than having fragile egos incessantly massaged with school prizes and no real competition. The moral? Sticks work better than carrots. Its fine to reward your children for good report cards, Tierney and Baumeister counsel, but you should also deduct something from their allowance if the grades show theyve been shirking. That way kids learn to shape up. Sometimes its good to be bad.","1202"

"2020-01-01T09:00:01Z","world","World news","Brazilians on Bolsonaro's first year: 'If you disagree, you're seen as a traitor'","It has been a year since a pro-gun, anti-indigenous far-right former army captain took power in Brazil and began sending shockwaves through the countrys government and society. In those 12 months, Jair Bolsonaro  who is openly homophobic and allied to Brazils hardline religious right  has declared war on film-makers, journalists and the environment; put a conspiracy theorist in charge of the foreign service; and greenlit a new era of police repression and rainforest destruction. Here, six prominent Brazilian voices from the arts, media, diplomacy and the Amazon offer their thoughts on Bolsonaros dramatic first year as president. Djamila Ribeiro, feminist philosopher, publisher and activist    It has been such a tough year  above all when it comes to public security. We feel really afraid of the intensifying repression of the black population and the increasing militarisation of the favelas. The number of black people being murdered in poor communities has increased, as has the number of indigenous leaders being killed.  But its important to remember how many people have resisted and how many [resistance] movements exist.  If theres a positive side to this government, its that issues of race and gender have never been talked about so much. This is now a mainstream debate in a country like Brazil  a country founded on the myth of racial democracy that denied the existence of racism for so long. This debate already existed. But now people are discussing and speaking out about these issues like never before. Bolsonaro has thrown wide open things that social movements have been talking about for centuries and people are starting to wake up. In 2020, the struggle goes on. Patrcia Campos Mello  award-winning journalist from Brazils Folha de So Paulo newspaper    This year confirmed our worst fears about the Bolsonaro governments relationship with the press. Weve seen it take an increasingly hostile stance, not just towards journalists but also critical and independent media outlets. There hadnt been any kind of censorship since the end of the military dictatorship [in 1985]  and now weve started to see a gradual erosion of freedom of expression. The other day I was talking to Nicaraguan and Venezuelan colleagues and they told me: Four years ago, we were going through exactly what youre going through. This is how it begins. Every time you write a critical piece, you become a target for Bolsonaro supporters. Id never been a target before  even when covering conflicts. I didnt even feel like a target in Syria. But here, its personal.  The aggressive messages and the fake news never stop. This is our new normal  especially for female journalists. Ive become used to being called a whore. Each time Im about to publish an article thats critical of the government, I prepare myself because I know the next day will be hell. Celso Amorim  former foreign minister, 2003-10    The last time I felt ashamed of Brazil was in the late 1960s. I was going up the escalators near the London School of Economics and I opened a magazine and it had a story about a Brazilian student who had been killed and tortured by the dictatorship. I had the impression everyone on the underground was looking at me. Now, again, I feel ashamed  for many reasons, but especially by what is being done in foreign policy. In 50 years Ive never seen anything like what is happening in Brazilian diplomacy today. Not even during the military government. Terrible things happened back then in Brazil. But our diplomacy was more skilful, more cautious and sought dialogue whenever possible. Now it has embarked upon an all-out ideological war against everything that is not western or Christian  according to their conception. I feel sorry for my colleagues in the foreign service because I know some of them are being forced to do what they do because its their only job. Its not very different from the US state department under Trump  only more exaggerated, more ridiculous. And of course Trump has 4,000 nuclear weapons  he can do whatever he wants.  Gustavo Bebianno  former Bolsonaro ally    The way the president is behaving is disastrous. So for me, this has been a disappointing year given the positive expectations I had before the elections. There are two different people: Captain Jair Bolsonaro is someone I highly respect [and] miss greatly But President Jair Bolsonaro is a disappointment for the way he has betrayed his country and much of what he promised in the campaign. He started to see himself as a some sort of mythological entity, blessed by God. He became extremely arrogant and wouldnt listen to anyone. You can agree with him about 99 things. But if you disagree on one and argue or try to offer another point of view, you are seen as a traitor. His administration became a sect of fanatics  and Im not a fanatic. [Bolsonaro] is surrounded by radicals [and] is scared of everything. He is constantly afraid of being betrayed. Thats why hes aggressive. Hes scared of journalists. He is scared of politicians. Davi Kopenawa Yanomami  indigenous intellectual, shaman and author    Indigenous people in Brazil feel a lot more fear under this president. This year, many illegal miners have entered our land. They pollute our rivers and kill our fish. Our people are starting to get malaria again. Bolsonaro is a garimpeiro [illegal miner]. He wants more land and fewer Indians. After he took power in January, he attacked us and said he no longer wants to recognise indigenous reserves. He calls us lazy and says we produce nothing. Thats exactly the argument the illegal miners use. I dont know the president personally, but I dont like what I hear of him on TV and read in the newspaper. He thinks in a military way. The military doesnt care about the land or indigenous people. That is bad for him and bad for us because he is president. He sets the direction of Brazil. In our culture, we dont damage the river and trees. We care for the forest. But the miners just bring destruction. Who is getting rich from this? Its not regular Brazilians in the cities. Its politicians who are selling the wealth of Brazil to foreigners.  I hope people outside can understand this and help us to defend ourselves and preserve nature. Karine Teles  actor    For Brazilian cinema, 2019 represented a gigantic pause. Nothing advanced. Everything was suspended. This is a massive loss for an industry that employed more than 300,000 people. Its not just a cultural loss, its an economic loss too. So many families no longer have a way of supporting themselves. The new government admits it wants to filter the content being produced with public money. But Brazils constitution outlaws censorship. You cant decide which films can and cant be made with public funds. Theres a committee responsible for selecting projects according to artistic qualities, the artists involved, the producer  not the themes being portrayed.  I think its an attempt to restrict the content of films. But our country is still a democracy where things work in a certain way. No leader  a mayor, a governor, or president  has the right to impose their personal tastes on the entire population. It makes no sense to obstruct a major industry that creates tax revenues, jobs and helps promote the name of our country around the world. I dont know if its about Bolsonaros tastes, how he sees things or the people in his government. But he himself has said the government wants to control what will be made and what wont  and this is censorship.","1265"
"2020-01-01T09:00:00Z","football","Football","The year in VAR: from World Cup guinea pigs to Premier League fury","The year in VAR begins in June, at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Scotland are on the verge of qualifying for the last 16 of their first ever Womens World Cup. They are 3-2 up and the match is in the 90th minute when a penalty is awarded to Argentina. Florencia Bonsegundo steps up to take and  its saved! And the follow-up too! But Scotlands goalkeeper Lee Alexander does not celebrate, she just gets up and glares. It turned out that was the right decision. Within a minute Alexanders heroics had been snuffed out. A VAR check of the penalty revealed that Alexanders feet had stepped off the goalline, her back foot by a matter of an inch, and the kick was ordered to be retaken. Bonsegundo took her second chance and a draw was not enough: Scotland were going home. The incident went on to become a source of great controversy. The England goalkeeper, Karen Bardsley, described the decision against Alexander as cruel and pedantic while the former US keeper Hope Solo, writing in the Guardian, lambasted the use of video refereeing technology in the World Cup as a whole. VAR has been so frustrating throughout this tournament, she said. Women were used as guinea pigs.   Related: VAR should only be used for 'clear and obvious' offside errors, say law makers   Those complaints from the French summer ring true in England in winter. Since the Premier League introduced VAR at the start of the season there have been important, game-changing decisions that have seemed highly pedantic; moments decided by the width of an armpit. The technology has been applied inconsistently (and slowly) by people with limited experience. As for new rules that have not helped matters, try on the handball law for size. In November, during a notably bullish presentation about VARs first few months, the Premier Leagues refereeing chief, Mike Riley, admitted to the technology having made four errors. One of them seemed to capture all the aspects of VAR that have proved contentious: a goal scored by Sokratis Papastathopoulos for Arsenal against Crystal Palace. The score was 2-2 and the match entering its final period when the centre-half smashed in what looked like a winning goal from a corner. It was scrappy, a Nicolas Pp kick flicked on at the near post into a crowd on the edge of the six-yard box, before spilling out to Papastathopoulos 10 yards out. His shot crossed the goalline at 82:18. Only when the clock hit 84.15 did the referee, Martin Atkinson, rule it out, for a perceived foul by Arsenals Callum Chambers in the buildup. Riley would later admit that Chambers had committed no such foul. But for fans  especially those in the stadium  that was little consolation. They had been denied a goal and potentially two league points. They had also endured the mortifying experience of having celebrated a goal that turned out never to have happened. The final indignity was that the decision to overturn took two minutes to make, a period that can feel like a lifetime in a stadium. The question many fans were asking was this: even if there had been a foul (which there had not) if it took two minutes to spot with a bank of video screens at your disposal, could the referees mistake really have been clear and obvious?    Scotlands Lee Alexander saves a penalty from Florencia Bonsegundo but VAR ordered a retake from which Argentina scored. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Archive/PA Images   Clear and obvious, clear and obvious. During the autumn those three words were repeated more often than boy done good. This was the high bar the Premier League had set itself, the criterion any incident would have to fulfil before the VAR would intervene in a referees decision. Alongside the original motto for the technology  minimum interference for maximum benefit  it seemed simple and straightforward enough. But it did not turn out like that. One problem with clear and obvious was that it was not supposed to apply in every situation. In decisions regarding offside or handball there was nothing subjective about it, according to Riley and co. So, if a decision was marginally wrong, it was still wrong and should be overturned. This led to initial confusion among fans and pundits alike. The same could be said of the phrase more broadly, with many people thinking a moment that was, say, clearly and obviously a foul, should require the VARs involvement when, in fact, it was only if the referee had made a clear and obvious error in not seeing it. That VARs themselves should interpret what was clear and obvious in a number of different ways should not, therefore, have proved surprising. But they did and sometimes it would result in minutes spent poring over details (see PastathopoulousPapastathopouloss goal) before coming to a conclusion that might flip a match on its head. VARs and the video operatives working alongside them also had varying levels of aptitude in applying the technology at their disposal. New 3D representations of an offside decision could take an age to be crafted, something that became even more frustrating when it turned out the cameras that had taken the original pictures were not fast enough to capture split-second actions in the first place.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  Fans in the ground rarely got to see these images; they were more often served up on TV. And it was the match-going fan who really got the short straw in VARs first few months. The rules, mostly established not by the Premier League but by the International Football Association Board (Ifab), which oversees the laws of the game, prevented footage being shown unless a decision had already been overturned. The body also prevented the crowd from receiving any communication from the referee. Fans were not only left sitting in a state of frustrated limbo for minutes at a time but often had no clue as to why. Amid all this frustration the fact that VAR had significantly improved the number of correct decisions (reducing what they call errors in Key Match Incidents from 47 by November 2018 to 24 at the same point in 2019) was by the by. Come November the Premier League went into listening mode, meeting fans groups and stakeholder clubs. Changes were promised. Big ones would have to wait for Ifab but small ones arrived in time for Christmas. Now at a Premier League match (at any ground bar Old Trafford and Anfield as they do not have big screens), when the VAR is in operation, the crowd are not just informed but given a reason why: VAR checking penalty  possible handball being one such example. Its a small step but when its applied in the ground the response is at least no longer one of incandescence. All people want is to understand what is happening. VAR may be here to stay but it seems fair to say there is more learning to be done before it can be called the finished item.","1132"

Please note the bold (or should that be bold?): these are to be taken with a pinch of salt. Tom Brady plays just one or two games this decade The New England Patriots ageless talisman has continually purported that he wants to play until hes 44 or 45 or whenever Father Time physically tosses him out of football. But 42-year-old Brady is quickly looking like a player with nothing more to gain by playing. While still a master tactician, his physicality and productivity are diminishing. His 6.6 yards per completion this season were his lowest since 2002 and theres little to indicate an upward tick is on the horizon. Brady has absolutely nothing left to prove. Quite frankly, every season he spends looking less like Brady in his prime and more like Peyton Manning in his very gimpy final season is a disservice to his TB12 brand which is founded on beating back the clock. Brady the savvy businessman will come to grips with this reality and bid football goodbye soon after getting ousted this postseason. MJ The end of total US dominance in womens gymnastics The US women led by Simone Biles will head into the 2020 Olympics as odds-on favorites to win their third consecutive team title. But Biles has already announced that she is planning to retire after 2020, leaving the future of US womens gymnastics dominance in doubt. The past decade of US gymnastics dominance is not entirely due to Biles  they won the 2011 and 2012 team titles without her  but since she arrived on the senior scene in 2013, the wins have felt a lot more comfortable. But the decade started with a Russian win at the 2010 world championships and with Aliya Mustafina being crowned all-around champion. And in a Biles-less world, Russia could find themselves on top again. At the inaugural junior world championships, the US placed third behind teams from Russia and China. While success in the juniors doesnt always translate to senior wins, other countries clearly have a lot of talent in their pipeline. While the US women will still win in the coming decade, it will no longer be as certain as the sun rising in the east. DM The NBA will agree to shorten the regular-season schedule Even hardcore basketball fans tend to find the 82-game slate an unnecessarily long slog. With ratings on the decline and teams resting their stars to keep them fresh for the postseason, its time for a change, Yes, teams will be hesitant to sacrifice the game-day revenue, but it could be vital for the long-term health of the league. (For the record. however, shortening the season just to add an in-season tournament isnt a solution to anything.) HF Promotion and relegation will (finally) come to Major League Soccer With the announcement that Charlotte will soon be home to a MLS franchise, North American soccers top flight swelled to 30 teams. That will make the division by some distance the largest in world soccer and with no fewer than four expansion spots being awarded in 2019 its unlikely that growth will stop there. At 26 clubs large, MLS is already experiencing issues, with the 2020 season the first to feature a completely lopsided fixture list - not every team will face each other, essentially rendering the Supporters Shield pointless. It seems infeasible that MLS could go beyond 30 teams without splitting into two tiers and so 2020 could be the year that the league finally announces its intention to implement promotion and relegation at some point in the not-so-distant future. Its long been speculated whether or not MLS would integrate itself into North Americas soccer pyramid. Now its getting big enough to be the pyramid all on its own. GR    Russias womens gymnastics team stands to make up ground once Simone Biles moves on from American duty. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images   Robots will call balls and strikes in at least one MLB game In December, the Associated Press reported that the Major League Umpires Association agreed to cooperate with the development and testing of an automated ball-strike system as part of a five-year labor agreement. The variance of every umpires strike zone and the growth of instant replay across sports has amplified the conversation regarding robot umpires and whether theyre the future of baseball officiating. With beta testing occurring in the independent Atlantic League and the reported new agreement between the union and MLB, it likely wont be long until the most sophisticated tracking software appears  even if its just for an inning  in an official game. GB The Olympics will get a reality check and split up Everyone wants to get into the Olympics  and no one wants to host. Rather than insist on a single host dealing with every event and being stuck with unused bobsled tracks and velodromes, the IOC will see the value in having multiple multi-sport festivals. Imagine a seaside Olympics for sailing, surfing, beach volleyball and a few other sports. Maybe the skating sports and curling can be in one city while a mountain region hosts everything else. Spread the Games, spread the costs, spread the fun. BD Womens soccer makes another quantum leap forward Having experienced probably the most dramatic changes of any sport in a 10-year period makes making bold predictions about the next decade of womens soccer harder because, in the context of the previous 10, everything looks sort-of wildly achievable. The new-ish professionalism is going to transform the game. We will see the womens game become a technically superior game than the mens. Not better, they are different sports to a large extent, but women players have to rely on their skill over their physicality and with a generation coming through that will have been trained from an early age the technical level will skyrocket. The game will also go through a bit of an identity crisis as it struggles to balance growth with avoiding everything that is hated about the mens game. SW Sam Kerr will become the legend she is destined to be As womens soccer becomes the tour de force that its meant to be, we shall see the continued rise of Aussie superstar Sam Kerr. Her recent move to Chelsea womens side cements that, although WoSo in the USA has dominated the worlds stage, we shall see an emerging European dominance in the womens game. Kerr has the youth, the power and potential to be one of the greatest players of all time, and outshine many. SA ","1078"

The ACTs acting chief health officer, Dr Paul Dugdale, said the smoke was the worst since the 2003 bushfires and was certainly the worst since air quality monitoring started in the city 15 years ago. Air quality index readings in Canberra city were at 3,463 on Wednesday afternoon, according to the ACT Health website. Ratings of more than 200 are considered hazardous. The suburb of Monash showed levels at 4,650 and Florey was at 3,508. An ACT health spokesperson said the AQI reading for fine particles peaked at 7700 at 1am on Wednesday at the Monash monitoring site.   Related: We know this disaster is unprecedented  no amount of Scott Morrison spin can hide it | Lenore Taylor   The Canberra-based University of NSW climate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis was out in the city with her two-year-old daughter and said the conditions were like nothing I have experienced before. She was planning to leave the city. Its permeating everything. It is the fine particulates that get through everything. This is the worst it has been, she said. Last night it started to blow in and you do start to feel quite anxious and stressed. Smoke just makes us all panic. Families and children visiting Questacon, the National Science and Technology Centre, had a look of shock, said Lewis, with many people wearing masks and checking phone apps for air quality and fire updates.  Current location: Questacon. Heaps of young families trying to escape the smoke, but its inside too. Everyone has this dazed, nearly panic-attacking face. Cant imagine the fear and anxiety for all who arent safe #AustraliaBurns #ClimateEmergency— Dr Catherine Ayres (@catherinetayres) December 31, 2019  She said a pattern in recent weeks had been for the smoke from bushfires burning to the east to arrive on cooler sea breezes in the evening. On Tuesday night and Wednesday, a phenomenon known as a temperature inversion had caused warmer air above to trap the smoke, making conditions especially bad. The Bureau of Meteorology was expecting a similar temperature inversion to cause further problems in the ACT on Wednesday night. On Wednesday morning Dugdale said 12 people had gone to Canberra hospital with smoke-related illnesses in the previous 24 hours. Dugdale said it was not the time for people to start any new year fitness resolutions and they should stay indoors instead. This is an exceptional time for Canberra  usually our air quality is among the best in the world, he said. The ACTs health directorate also issued fresh advice on Wednesday, saying all Canberrans should avoid physical activity outside.  ACT HEALTH ALERT: Air quality deterioration across the ACT from smoke. Read more at: https://t.co/giX6iUa0eH pic.twitter.com/CzTBjcn2Du— ACT Health (@ACTHealth) December 31, 2019  The public was advised to stay indoors with windows and doors closed and to turn evaporative air conditioners off. The extremely thick smog was forecast to linger for several days, with conditions expected to remain poor, and temperatures on Saturday forecast to climb to 42C. A statement said: We also strongly advise people who are sensitive to smoke, especially those with pre-existing heart and lung conditions, to take extra care during these conditions. People who are sensitive to smoke and air pollution can be more vulnerable to heat-related illness as well, so staying hydrated and cool is important. People who are able to do so, are also encouraged to check on others who they think might need extra help, to see that they are okay. In NSW on Wednesday, the air quality index was at very high hazardous levels of 2,300 around Goulburn, caused by smoke from nearby bushfires. Hazardous conditions were also detected in regions of Sydneys south-west (352), and in the central tablelands (394) and southwest slopes (360).  It's the first day of 2020 and the air quality in #Goulburn NSW is officially 1640; 200 is considered hazardous.https://t.co/Bjhw7CW4FeIt's been similar for weeks.Thoughts with those who are facing much worse: the flames.Happy New Year, I guess?#AustraliaBurns pic.twitter.com/woOc78rruo— Nigel Featherstone (@NGFeathers) December 31, 2019 ","567"
"2020-01-01T08:31:35Z","football","Football","Football transfer rumours: Moussa Dembélé to join Chelsea's strikeforce?","If a transfer window can slam shut then it can also spring open. Theres no such thing as New Years Day signalling a dry January in the heady world of football transfers. This is where the party starts for 31 days of signing-on fees, yellow tickers and term sheets with agents and ITKs hammering the WhatsApp like thunder. Now that the revoking of Chelseas transfer ban means he is able to open Roman Abramovichs cheque book, Frank Lampard fancies rolling back the years to the clubs glory days and spending like Viv Nicholson. Frank sees Moussa Dembl  once of Fulham and Celtic, now of Lyon  as a potential new Didier Drogba, which may be bad news for Tammy Abraham. Another option as a forward is the CSKA Moscow striker Fyodor Chalov who would cost around 20m.    Related: Transfer window January 2020 every deal from Europe's top five leagues   Meanwhile, Olivier Girouds desire for first-team football before Euro 2020 and Wilfried Zahas permanent state of being the subject of transfer speculation has led to talk of some kind of swap deal, with the Frenchman heading to Crystal Palace and Zaha joining Franks entertainers on Londons fashionable Kings Road. Also for the Chelsea off may be Emerson Palmieri, who is wanted by Antonio Conte at Internazionale. And on the opposite side of the defence, Chelsea are willing to pay 30m to sign Ricardo Pereira from Leicester, with Tottenham also interested.  Emersons availability may be a prelude to Chelsea showing serious interest in Ben Chilwell, though Manchester Citys long-term courting of the Leicester left-back remains undiminished in its ardour. This January could see the opening skirmishes of a running battle between Jos Mourinho and Daniel Levy over transfer policy, and the Tottenham manager wants three players to come in. Firstly, a centre-half: that may be one of Bournemouths Nathan Ak or West Hams Issa Diop. Next, Serge Auriers ears may be burning with the suggestion that a right-back is being targeted: Napolis Elseid Hysaj and Marseilles Hiroki Sakai are two names in the offing beyond Pereira. And, with Christian Eriksen entering the limbo of being able to sign a contract with a new club from 1 January, an attacking midfielder is desired. Gremios Everton Soares fits that bill.   Related: January transfer window 2020: club-by-club guide for the Premier League   Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who seems set to be a mainstay of these pages for a while to come, has been linked with Barcelona while Inter and Conte also want him. Meanwhile, Granit Xhakas loan move to Hertha Berlin from Arsenal  with a view to a permanent move  is set to be done imminently, even if Mikel Arteta retains an admiration for the Swiss firebrand.  This may not be one for this month, but links continue to grow between Manchester United and Jude Bellingham, Birmingham Citys best 16-year-old since Trevor Francis was bashing them in at St Andrews back in 1970. The club hasnt mentioned anything to me about Jude Bellingham, said the Blues manager, Pep Clotet, before his teams match with Wigan but it seems more than likely that a Premier League fanbase will be belting out Hey Jude in Bellinghams honour by the start of the 2020-21 season. The best news for United is that young Jude is not yet a Mino Raiola client or related to a former Manchester City player. Or at least as far as anyone knows. Elsewhere in the Championship, Cameron Carter-Vickers is set to return to parent club Tottenham from his loan at Stoke, where he has not been getting on the field in the past month, and be sent straight out on another loan, to Derby.","585"
"2020-01-01T08:30:00Z","us-news","US news","The final sprint: will any of the Democratic candidates excite voters?","Democrats overwhelmingly agree that their top priority in 2020 is to remove Donald Trump from office. But which of the many Democrats running for president is best suited to the task remains a source of deep anxiety and division less than five weeks before the Iowa caucuses. After more than a year of campaigning, the Democratic presidential primary enters the final sprint before voting begins on 3 February in Iowa in a familiar but fluid state: Joe Biden in the lead, trailed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with Pete Buttigieg also showing signs of strength in the early states. But, in what has become a quadrennial dilemma for a party prone to fretting over elections, Democrats appear unsatisfied with their choices and worry none of their candidates can beat Trump. A CNN poll from last month found that only 31% of potential Democratic primary voters are very satisfied with the field, the lowest level of its three surveys that asked that question. Democrats fear Biden is too old, gaffe-prone and does not excite the activist base. They also worry Sanders and Warren are too far left and will alienate moderates. And they worry Buttigieg is too young and inexperienced.   Related: Democratic candidates reject Obamas warning of going too far left   Suddenly every candidate has clay feet. Voters are worried. There is no perfect candidate but there never is, said Elaine Karmack, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns who studies primaries as a scholar at the Brookings Institution. Fear of another Trump election has turned Democrats into self-professed pundits, determined to suss out the most electable candidate. The perception that Biden is best placed to beat Trump, at least among some voters, has strengthened his resilience despite a series of stumbles and controversies. A central thesis of Bidens campaign  which he increasingly states in blunt terms on the campaign trail  is that he is the candidate most likely to reassemble a Democratic coalition by appealing to white working class voters who Trump won over in 2016 and to black voters who are critical to the Democratic base. But rising in second place is Sanders, who rebounded from a heart attack in October and sinking poll numbers earlier this year. His comeback has reinforced  and even expanded  his standing among the partys left wing after months of watching Warren rise to to the front of the pack. The last two candidates standing The policy debate and jostling between the partys many factions has framed much of the contest until this point. Biden and Sanders, the only candidates to have previously run for president, represent the ideological poles of the primary field  and two competing theories of how to beat Trump. Biden argues Trump is an aberration who can be defeated by the election of a president with the goodwill and experience to unite the country and restore the nations standing abroad. Sanders believes Trump is a symptom of an American political system and economy warped by money, greed and inequality. In his view, rooting out Trumpism will require not only a Democratic president but sweeping political and economic reforms. The divide over which path to take in 2020 has emerged as a central fault line in the Democratic race. In this primary we must commit to being aspirational  to really explain what we expect the next president to build not just by refuting what Trump has done but by building a vision for a future that comes after Trump, said Mara Urbina, the national political director for progressive group Indivisible. If youre not excited to vote for somebody, your neighbors and your friends  everyone who we need to turn out this election to beat Trumps turnout machine  are probably not going to be very excited to vote for them either. In December, Indivisible released a scorecard that ranks the 2020 Democratic field by how closely each candidate aligned with top progressive priorities. The scorecard is a way to signal to its thousands of local organizations which candidates they should back. Warren earned the highest score at 95% while Biden ranked the lowest at 50%. Warren rose steadily last summer to the top of the field with a registry of plans that would fundamentally remake the US economy but she has receded in recent months amid criticism over her health care proposal. Warren and Sanders, ideological allies whose supporters overlap, are now tangled up for second and third place. Progressive groups are taking sides even as the candidates refuse to go after one another out of fear of antagonizing the others supporters, which one of them would need to consolidate to win the nomination. Moderates, meanwhile, are hopeful that the two will divide the left and keep each other from capturing the nomination. But after years of losing factional feuds, progressives are emboldened by their political prominence in the race. The beauty of having more than one progressive candidate in the race is that they have a large, strong base and they have the resources and infrastructure to go all the way into the 2020 calendar year, said Rebecca Katz, a liberal political consultant. Its possible we could be in a situation where they are two of the last candidates standing  and thats a good thing for the progressive movement. Who can beat Trump? Even as polling paints a steady picture of the primary race, the contest remains far from settled. Perhaps one of the biggest uncertainties is Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who entered the race in late November. His strategy for winning the nomination is unorthodox: he wont contest the early states that every other candidate is scrapping over. Instead, he has poured tens of millions of dollars from his personal fortune into TV and digital advertising into the big, delegate-rich Super Tuesday states going to the polls on 3 March. But there is plenty of time for other surprises before then. One of the most significant developments in the race so far came in November, when Kamala Harris, a US senator from California and the only black woman running for president, abruptly ended her campaign.  Her departure sparked a debate among Democrats over how the most diverse primary field in political history has stratified into a top-tier of only white and mostly male candidates. The discussion briefly boosted fundraising for Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator who is black, and Julin Castro, the former housing secretary who is Latino. But the fleeting attention wasnt enough to qualify for the December debate, and Castro subsequently dropped out of the race. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who is polling at 3% nationally and is Asian American, said during the last debate that it was both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on stage. No candidate of color has yet qualified for the next debate in January in Iowa, as the first voters prepare to actually cast their ballots. But the Democrats will now have to compete for media attention with the Senate impeachment trial expected in January. For the senators running for president, this will require time off the campaign trail and in Washington to participate as jurors in the trial. Several candidates have staked their campaigns on a strong finish in Iowa, including Buttigieg, Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, the US senator from Minnesota. Bidens team has signaled that it has low expectations for Iowa. Instead, Biden expects to pull ahead in South Carolina, where he maintains a strong base of support among black voters. On the campaign trail and the debate stage, the candidates will make their closing arguments to voters. After months of debating policy and politics, their final pitches are expected to focus on the issue that matters most to Democrats: why they are the partys best hope of beating Trump. Right now, the biggest priority for Democratic voters is who can beat Donald Trump, said Michael Starr Hopkins, a Democratic strategist who previously worked on John Delaneys 2020 presidential campaign. Its not the whole game but its the most important part of it because if you thought what Trump did in his first term was bad, imagine what he is capable of in a second term.","1355"

 8.07am GMT 
Summary

We are ending this blog for today. 
While fires continued to burn today they were not as catastrophic as Tuesday. Instead, we learned a lot about the absolute devastation wrought along the NSW south coast and Victorias East Gippsland region.

Nine people have died since Monday, and five are missing.
Across NSW, Victoria, and South Australia, 17 people have been confirmed dead in bushfires since October.
NSW RFS commissioner, Shane FitzSimmons, warned the NSW death toll would rise, as further cases were confirmed.
Fitzsimmons said the lack of communication is making it difficult for authorities to determine who is still missing.
At least 200 homes were destroyed on the South Coast yesterday, and at least 60 in East Gippsland.
If we had 10,000 firefighters we wouldnt be able to put these fires out, said deputy RFS commissioner Rob Rogers.
Authorities said the majority of the south coast fires were the result of natural activity  like lightning.
Saturday is forecast to be worse than yesterday in NSW, across a broader geographic area, with extreme conditions dominating the regions where there are already some of the most damaging and destructive fires burning.
Two bushfires have merged on South Australias Kangaroo Island and are expected to burn for weeks.
HMAS Choules is expected to arrive at Mallacoota tomorrow morning, for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief capability. Its among a large deployment of ADF assets to assist in evacuations of the thousands of people still stranded, and to replace exhausted fire crews.
Power is slowly being restored to small parts of the NSW south coast, but is likely to be out for weeks in many places.
Some roads are beginning to reopen to very restricted traffic this afternoon, as authorities work to have currently stranded people  especially tourists  leave the area before conditions worsen again this weekend.

There is an active emergency level fire in Western Australia. The warning was issued for parts of Orelia in the city of Kwinana. Homes on Colchester Avenue were under threat from a fire in Sandringham Park which started near the intersection of Colchester Avenue and Dunrobin Avenue and was moving north east.

Updated at 7.48am GMT


 7.33am GMT 

FitzSimmons says the Dunn Road fire is going be upgraded again to an emergency fire as the fire behaviour was increasing and spreading.
These fires are in some of NSWs most beautiful yet most rugged and difficult-to-access terrain.
Weve seen the enormity of damage and destruction which unfolded yesterday and unfortunately Saturday is likely to be worse.



 7.31am GMT 

From the premier, Gladys Berejiklian:
Just because you cant see flames doesnt mean the road is safe to use. Having seen the number of trees burnt out, having seen the bring alongside these roads, I completely understand why the emergency authorities need to make sure they are safe before people can use them. 
Having said that, we are grateful for milder weather conditions over the next few days and where roads can be accessed, we will be encouraging tourists especially to move out of those areas while its safe to do so, because we are concerned what the weather might bring us on Saturday, given what has been forecast and given what weve experienced over the last few days.

 7.30am GMT 

There is an evening update with the NSW premier and senior fire and police chiefs at the NSW RFS headquarters.
We are getting indications with the forecast for Saturday that it is going to present a broader geographic area worse than what we saw yesterday when it comes to fire danger, with a fairly widespread area of extreme conditions which will dominate the south eastern corner of the state, through the southern slopes, southern ranges, parts of the high country and through to places like the Illawarra and Shoalhaven, Shane FitzSimmons says.
Unfortunately that also correlates with where weve got some of the worst and most damaging and destructive of fires burning in New South Wales at the moment.
Firefighters are keeping a close eye on the Green wattle Creek fire where it has flared up in the north-east corner. Firefighters are addressing it ahead of the worsening conditions later this week.
Access from Batemans Bay north will be open to some very restricted access from this afternoon, says NSW police deputy commissioner Worboys.
Towards south of Batemans Bay, we will also work with some local roads down the coast that will bring people down in through Bega, and across Brown Mountain, into Coomera, Canberra, and they can make their way up towards Goulburn, up the Hume towards Sydney and out further west.
He says theres a long way to go but they are working to restore power, with some back on in places like Ulladulla and near Batemans Bay. He says everyone has been very patient and hes grateful.
In our evacuation centres that are full, it is trying times, and people have heeded the warnings, theyve cooperated well, and we just ask them again to continue in that spirit through tonight, into tomorrow, and we look forward to some further power restoration, some more road openings, and of course increased communications up and down the south coast.

Two bushfires have merged on South Australias Kangaroo Island and are expected to burn for weeks, as firefighters prepare for a dangerous wind change, AAP reports.
The fires started about five kilometres apart in the inaccessible Ravine Des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area and have burnt through more than 7500 hectares of native vegetation, timber plantations and private property.
On Wednesday afternoon the combined fire was uncontrolled and burning in a northerly direction towards Snug Cove.
Firefighters and water-bombing aircraft are focused on protecting assets, but the Country Fire Service said efforts might be hampered by changing weather conditions and poor visibility.
If the blaze remains uncontained, northerly winds forecast for Friday could push it towards the Flinders Chase National Park.
For the safety of tourists and the community, the CFS and SA National Parks and Wildlife Service have closed the park from midnight Wednesday until further notice. Extensive road closures are also in place on the western end of the island.
The CFS has confirmed the Cudlee Creek fire, which broke out on December 20 and destroyed at least 70 homes, has been contained.



 7.05am GMT 

The Dunns Road fire has been downgraded to a watch and act, which means there are currently no emergency level fires or warnings in NSW or Victoria. Having said that, the ABC has just reported the Currowan fire has jumped the Shoalhaven river in spots, which is not great news for people around Wingello, Penrose and Bundanoon.

Further details from NSW police about the seven confirmed deaths in the southern NSW fires.
Since Monday, emergency services have responded to the following fatal incidents:

A 28-year-old RFS volunteer firefighter, Sam McPaul, died at a property on River Road, Jingellic, just before 6pm on Monday.
A father and son, Robert and Patrick Salway  aged 63 and 29  died at a property at Wandella, about 10km north-west of Cobargo, on Monday.
A 70-year-old man was found dead outside a home at Yatte Yattah, about 6km west of Lake Conjola, on Tuesday.
The body of a man was found in a burned-out car on a road off the Princes Highway at Yatte Yattah about 7.30am today.
The body of a man was found in a vehicle on Wandra Road, Sussex Inlet about 11.30am today. He is yet to be formally identified.
A body has been found outside a home at Coolagolite, about 10km east of Cobargo, today. ( I believe this is the person found by ambulance officers. We did not have a location earlier.)

A 72-year-old man at Belowra and a 70-year-old woman at Conjola Park are still both unaccounted for.

Good afternoon. This is Helen Davidson here to take you through the rest of the days live coverage of the continuing Australian bushfire crisis.
In NSW there is one emergency-level fire in the Snowy Valleys. The Dunns Road fire has burned more than 100,000 hectares. Conditions are easing but it is burning south of the Snowy Mountains Highway in the Ellerslie Range, and the south-westerly change is pushing the fire towards the areas of Kunama, Wondalga and surrounds. People there are urged to leave now towards Tumut if they arent prepared.
There are six watch and act fires in the state, all in the south.
In Tasmania there is one emergency warning for a fire in the north-east at Fingal through to Mathinna. The alert was issued about two hours ago and warned of high risk to the area, with the fire difficult to control. People north of Moonameeta were urged to evacuate to Mathinna. There are six other watch and act alerts, mainly in the north-east but also one north-west of Hobart.
In Victoria there are currently no emergency warnings, as the Sunbury fire has been downgraded. There are 11 watch and act warnings issued. 
There is one watch and act fire in South Australia, on Kangaroo Island.

Updated at 6.51am GMT


 6.11am GMT 

And there are months to go.
Today we had both NSW and Victorias emergency chiefs tell us they could not get around these fires. That 10,000 firefighters on the ground would not be enough to stop the blazes.
All that is going to help is a change in conditions, but instead we are facing Saturday being worse than what we saw on Tuesday.
And there are months to go in this season. MONTHS.
On that dour note, I am going to hand you over to Helen Davidson for the evening coverage.
Stay safe and pay attention to the warnings in your area. And please  take care of you.

Firefighters and water-bombing aircraft are focused on protecting assets, but the Country Fire Service said efforts might be hampered by changing weather conditions and poor visibility.
If the blaze remains uncontained, northerly winds forecast for Friday could push it towards the Flinders Chase National Park.
For the safety of tourists and the community, the CFS and SA National Parks and Wildlife Service have closed the park from midnight Wednesday until further notice. Extensive road closures are also in place on the western end of the island.
A watch-and-act alert remains active and local residents are being urged to leave the area if not confident of defending property.

The defence department has just provided an update through the ABC on when the humanitarian ship, HMAS Choules, will arrive in Mallacoota.

Its making better than faster time and should be there tomorrow morning.
It sailed this morning, or shortly before lunch. Shes embarked an amount of what Id call humanitarian assistance and disaster relief capability and she should be off the Mallacoota Beach some time very early tomorrow morning. 
She has capability that includes a helicopter thats embarked and a range of disaster relief stores and equipment and personnel that can support and respond to other coastal areas where there might be isolated communities and render support and assistance to them. 
We would do so at the behest of the Victorian emergency management authorities.

There is a bit of confusion around the number of dead and missing.
Since Christmas, nine people have died in bushfires across NSW and Victoria, and at least four people are missing.
The firefighter Sam McPaul, 28, died when his fire truck was overturned by extreme winds east of Albury on Monday.
The father and son Robert and Patrick Salway were found dead inside their house in Cobargo on Tuesday.
A man is unaccounted for and presumed dead in Belowra. The NSW police deputy commissioner, Gary Worboys, said authorities had been unable to access the location west of Narooma to confirm a report.
A man has died in his home on Myrtle Gully Road, west of Lake Conjola, police also confirmed. The mans body showed no signs of trauma or burns and police dont believe it is suspicious.
In Buchan, Victoria, 67-year-old Mick Roberts died in the East Gippsland fires.
On Wednesday Worboys confirmed three further deaths in the south coast fires.
The police have confirmed at Yatte Yattah, a body found in a vehicle there, which is near Lake Conjola. One at Sussex Inlet and a body in a vehicle. And ambulance officers have told us about a body that they have located as well deceased.
There remains concern over another person, also in Lake Conjola, where a house has been destroyed by fire and the occupant reported missing.
Were sifting through that now with RFS, forensics and fire and rescue New South Wales to work out whats occurred there, Worboys said.
Three people are still believed to be missing in fire areas in Victoria.
The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane FitzSimmons, warned the NSW death toll would rise, as further cases were confirmed.

Scott Morrison finished with this:

But the fires do rage on. It is a time of great challenge for Australia. 
Whether theyre started by lightning storms or whatever the cause may be, our firefighters and all of those who have come behind them to support them, whether theyre volunteering in the front line or behind the scenes in a great volunteer effort, it is something that will happen against the back drop of this Test match. 
But at the same time, Australians will be gathering, whether its at the SCG or around television sets all around the country, and theyll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think theyll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians and the way that people have gone about remembering the terrible things that other Australians are dealing with at the moment.

Weve been so well supported by those from so many other nations during these terrible fires and none more so than our Kiwi cousins. And as you go out there on Friday, I know you will be going out there, and particularly the Australian team, thinking of the terrible fires that are under way at the moment and I want to thank you, Tim [Paine] and the team and both captains, for the commemoration that youll make in wearing the black armbands for those who weve lost over the course of these fires. 
In particular, having lost Sam McPaul just the other day in just a dreadful, terrible incident just outside of Albury, but also Geoff Keaton and Andrew ODwyer who we lost earlier in the fire season. 
And your recognition of them during the course of this Test match I think will mean a lot to their families and a lot to their mates who served alongside them in these terrible fires.

Here in Australia, and also in New Zealand, with the White Island tragedy, and those terrible events to this very day, and theyll be ongoing during the course of this Test match.
And in all of these terrible events, be it the fires or the White Island tragedy, as in so many times before, Australia and New Zealand have always stood together. And that has been very true on this occasion as well. 
I today want to particularly recognise the contribution of New Zealands firefighters and what they have done to support their Australian mates here at this testing time. Since November, more than a hundred firefighters and incident manager team, aviation specialists have supported our teams battling the blazes in New South Wales.

The Bega MP and NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, who was briefly unaccounted for yesterday after defending his home from fires, has urged people to not return to their homes until it is judged safe.

One thing, youve just got to take your hats off to the RFS and the volunteers and the staff incident team.
I mean, they had to deal with hell yesterday. Our police, everyone, we just need everyone to keep listening to each other and the message that needs to go out is  and I experienced this yesterday, the trees are coming down like theres no tomorrow and Ive got a photo of someone who drove under a tree and theyre lucky to be alive because its come down on their boot. 
So people just need to listen. 
The roads are closed for a reason, theyre so trees dont come down and kill someone. 
You know, I dont want that. People have to wait an extra day or two so we can save lives  then just do it.

Power in some of those NSW south coast areas is likely to remain out for some time to come.
From AAP:

Fire-ravaged communities along a 180km stretch of NSWs south coast are likely to be without power and some telecommunications for an extended period after at least 40 power poles were destroyed.
NSW police said power had been lost from South Nowra to Moruya and potentially beyond on Tuesday, affecting at least 46,000 people.
The outage also affected communication lines, including landlines and internet.
Endeavour Energy on Wednesday said more than 18,000 of its customers remained powerless and were likely to remain so for some time.
At least 40 power poles have been destroyed, as have conductors. The RFS must grant workers permission to access the scorched areas.
Where it is safe and feasible to do so, we recommend residents find alternative accommodation until power supply can be safely restored to their homes, the energy company said in a statement.
Endeavour said it had restored power to Ulladulla customers.

One at Sussex Inlet, a body in a vehicle. And ambulance officers have told us about a body that they have located as well deceased.
In terms of the situation down on the south coast, we have three emergency operation centres operating locally up and down the coast that are dealing with any amount of local issues and doing their best to solve those problems for people down there.
There is no magic wand to wave across this and fix it in a short amount of time.

AAP has this update on Tasmania:

An emergency alert has been issued for a suspicious bushfire in Tasmania.
The alert was issued on Wednesday afternoon for Mathinna Road because of the threatening Mingana fire.
Burning embers, falling on Mathinna Road, Fingal through to Mathinna will threaten your home before the main fire, the alert reads.
The fire has been burning since Monday and police believe it was arson.
Police have reason to believe the main fire, as well as other fires in the area, have been deliberately lit, Northern District Commander Brett Smith said.
Bushfires are devastating, destructive, and in this case has displaced people from their homes. Someone must know something about who is responsible for this fire.
Watch and act alerts are also still in place for the fire at Pelham, north of Hobart, where a home was destroyed and other property damaged on Tuesday.

Rob Rogers on whether or not there is enough resources:

Well, I guess, you can always use more but at the end of the day the amount of fire trucks that we throw at these fires from all the agencies, fire rescue, they threw everything they had, RFS did, National Parks were doing that, so were State Forests. 
There were thousands and thousands of firefighters at these fires. 
You cant say youll always have enough for every scenario. Its an impossible situation. 
If we had 10,000 firefighters we wouldnt be able to put these fires out.
Where were at at the moment, the support weve had from both interstate and overseas has helped enormously. 
Weve got a huge amount of aircraft. 
Weve never had five large air tankers in this state before. 
So were well resourced but that doesnt mean that were going to be able to do everything and protect everyone. 
I think weve been upfront as these situations unfolded. 
Unfortunately, like weve seen down the south coast, we were starting to lose property at 3.30 in the morning. 
We were getting calls for people that were stuck in their homes and thats the sort of scenario that unfortunately were faced with. 
People that are being woken to fire threatening their homes. 
Thats why we keep saying to people, dont wait for a message.
 Dont wait for the fire to be there  if its going to be a bad day, just be away from that area.
Thats the safest thing we can do to try and prevent more loss of life.
Unfortunately I hate the number of homes weve lost but at the end of the day this is about peoples lives.
Thats the most important thing right now.

And on the question of whether there is much more to burn, the RFS deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, says:

Most of the area thats been impacted certainly in the south has been on the ranges and fires that have then impacted in the coastal area.
Theres a lot of area around the Snowy Mountains, Kosciuszko area, a lot of area south and west of Canberra that hasnt burned.
Theres lightning thats started and thats a concern. Theres still significant amounts of bushland that can still burn.
Were very concerned about the threat that poses on Saturday given the amount of fire we have in the landscape now and our inability to be able to get containment on those fires.
We would not be able to get around these fires. Just because where theyre burning is in such an area thats not easy to get to.
Theres no easy containment lines. We would have to get earth moving equipment in to try and create containment lines. It isnt just as simple to try and get around these fires. Thats why were being upfront  we cant get around them.
 Saturday is not looking like its going to be a good day at all. A tough day.

Deputy NSW RFS commissioner Rob Rogers:

All these fires, these sort of fires, the only way we stop them is by back burning. Thats the only way to actually do it. 
These fires are burning in the middle of nowhere. Our choices are to backburn or sit there and wait for them to hit us. 
We to try and do something. It doesnt always work. At the end of the day thats the only thing we can try and do to contain these fires. 
We like to have a few days before bad weather hits these fires. But at the moment were in less than ideal circumstances. 
So we have to try our best and do whatever strategies we think are the best things to try and protect the most people.

Fires at Werri Berri in the Bega Valley and about 20km east of Cooma are still burning. There is a lot of lightning in the Cooma area, which has fire authorities concerned. There are still fires in the Albury and Jingellic area.
Three people just west of Moruya were airlifted for medical treatment. Another two were taken by ambulance, with an RFS escort.
The RFS has also confirmed 176 homes have been lost.

'We are leading by example' on emissions reduction  David Littleproud

Speaking of Australia and climate change, David Littleproud doubled down on that on ABC AM radio this morning.
Kim Landers: After all of this, weve seen incident controller, after incident controller, and plenty of experts say that they have seen nothing like this before. Do you acknowledge that the federal government now has to do more about climate change?
David Littleproud: Well, we are and continue to, weve made our commitments, internationally and we intend to [keep them].
Landers: Youve made those commitments internationally, I know the government says it will live up to those commitments, but there are a lot of people saying more needs to be done, something more than just meeting those commitments.
Littleproud: Thats what we will have to do to meet those commitments and we continue to make those endeavours and that is what we continue to look to, to actually supplement renewable energies, we have given subsidies to those to get them up to a point, to get them competitive from a market prospective, so the reality is the government continues to work through it.
All industries, even in agriculture, which equates to 17% of reductions of emissions are looking to get to carbon neutrality by 2030 themselves, so industry and government are working together to ensure we do our bit.
Landers: Do you think the public is going to think that is enough though?
Littleproud: Its not just ... it is also important, it would be unrealistic to think Australia can do it by ourselves. 
We are leading by example and we expect the rest of the world to come with us, because we are 1.3% of emissions and we expect the rest of the world to do their bit as well, because if we all work globally together  and we are working globally in these fires, we have US firefighters, Canadian, New Zealanders.
If we work together, collaboratively as a world community, then we will be able to meet our emissions reduction targets as a globe, not just Australia.

AAP has an update on what is happening in Western Australia at the moment:

More than 220 firefighters and 100 support personnel are battling a large bushfire in Western Australias south, with a watch and act warning in place for residents and tourists.
The blaze at Stirling Range national park, in the states Great Southern region, has blackened more than 33,000 hectares since being sparked by lightning on Boxing Day.
Firefighter numbers have been bolstered from the 175 who were working to build and strengthen containment lines on Tuesday.
A watch and act message remains in place for people in the park as well as parts of the Shire of Gnowangerup, City of Albany, Shire of Plantagenet and Shire of Cranbrook.
There is a possible threat to lives and homes as the fire is still uncontrolled, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services warned on Wednesday.


Updated at 3.06am GMT


 2.52am GMT 

He finishes that answer with this:

That action by Australia alone will not change everything but if everyone has that attitude, if every nation state says it is not me, I wont make a difference, it is a bit like any form of pollution  if everyone just think they can throw the rubbish out the car and it does not make a difference, the rubbish around our cities and regions and towns, then where will we end up? 
We will end up with a hell of a mess! 
What were seeing here is that ... there is a need for Australia to take domestic action and at the moment they do not have an energy policy, they do not have a climate change plan and what we also need them to do then is to take that, that will come from a national program, and take that into international forums and argue for stronger international action.
 Because we know that the predictions are also that the nature of the Australian continent, with the impact we are seeing as a result of the drought, the dryness, will mean that we will be particularly impacted by climate change.
This is why we need global action. At the moment we do not have domestic action that is appropriate and we have Australia playing a negative role in the international forums.

Anthony Albanese on coal:

Climate change is affected by fossil fuel burning. We know that anthropogenic climate change is caused by human intervention, the industrial revolution and in human times, we know that this has impacted, just the way we knew that CFCs were having an impact on the ozone layer, and the world came together, the world came together to find solutions. 
I am confident we can find solutions, but we need to avoid dangerous climate change. What were seeing at the moment is dangerous. We are seeing that the predictions of the scientists, unfortunately, played out. 
The scientists told us that the fire seasons will be longer and more intense, that there would be more intense cyclones, more intense extreme weather events.
Tragically, we are seeing that occur and that is why it needs a response that does not play games with accountancy fiddlers in conferences, that lowers emissions and that is relative to global emissions, of course, it is accurate.

Anthony Albanese on whether or not he believes Scott Morrison is taking the situation seriously enough:

Obviously he is treating it seriously, all Australians are treating it seriously. But what we are not getting is the sort of coordination that we need and I think that the prime minister has continued over a range of issues, is one of his go-to media talking points, to speak about we dont want to panic, we do not want to have any alarm, young people should not be scared by climate change.
 I tell you what, young people watching the footage on the news at the moment would be pretty scared, it is scary, it is scary for everyone. 
That means that we need a considered response but I think that the prime minister, in terms of some of his tone, could accurately reflect the views I am getting back from the community, where ever I go.

Addressing the Greens calls for a royal commission into the bushfires, which Luke posted about a little earlier today, Anthony Albanese says Labor is open to it, but wants something which will result in action now:

Well, I think its immediate action that is required, not something that will report in six months, which is the minimum time for a royal commission normally. They take years rather than months, and what we need right now is for Coag to be convened.
I wrote to the prime minister in November calling for that. I called for that and it has not happened.
We have seen that there has been, therefore, a lack of coordination, a lack of a national approach, for example, to the compensation for volunteer firefighters.
A call for, that was one of the elements I said should be discussed there. We should discuss the resourcing and we have seen changes in terms of the amount of defence assets which have been applied here. 
It is appropriate that we actually convene all the levels of government for what is a national crisis, we see that these bushfires do not respect state boundaries and nor should we when it comes to the response to this issue.

 2.44am GMT 

Anthony Albanese:

They want leadership on the economy, they want leadership on bushfires, and they want an end to complacency.
This is not business as usual, this fire season.
Climate change is certainly having an impact as well, and they expect more than newspaper articles, whether it be from Scott Morrison today, or the quite remarkably misleading piece by Angus Taylor, that Australia is somehow pulling our weight.
They expect actually a bit of fair dinkum truth about what is going on because they can see it. They can smell it. And we are seeing the impact of complacency.
Australia cannot do it all on our own. That is absolutely right. But the truth is Angus Taylor went to the Madrid conference and argued along with a few other countries for less action, not more. 
Argued for an accounting trick rather than reducing emissions.

Today there is news of another fatality, a man found in a burnt-out car near Lake Conjola. 
But its been four deaths in recent days, but 14 over this horrendous bushfire season. It is time for the prime minister to convene Coag. 
I wrote to him in November and we saw with the issue of him coming to an arrangement with Gladys Berejiklian, the New South Wales premier, and then belatedly contacting the other states that what we actually need is national leadership and a national approach. 
Of course, the prime minister had said that it was a distraction, the issue of volunteer firefighters being given economic compensation. 
He then said it was a state issue. And then he said, most remarkably, they want to be there. They do not want to be there. 
No one wants these horrendous scenes that have been played out that look like something that is quite unbelievable. 
The prime minister also says, in a piece today, in the tabloid newspapers, he speaks about not panicking. He speaks about the quiet Australians.
Well, the Australians I have met here in Queensland and, indeed, throughout the country are not that quiet at the moment. 
They actually want leadership.

I just got back from Lake Tyers community, where about 40 people are preparing for another bad day on Saturday. Theyre running out of water and only have a slip-on tank for the ute. Charmaine Sellings, the fire captain, is worried but she says the community is holding together. pic.twitter.com/2uJKpTLtsn Calla Wahlquist (@callapilla)

The Lake Tyers Aboriginal community has begun to run out of water this morning.
The Aboriginal-owned Gunai/Kurnai community, which is only 11km east of Lakes Entrance as the crow flies but about 25 minutes by road, has been cut off since Monday.
About 45 people chose to remain in the community as the fire threatened and retreated to the health centre. Their only protection is the fire chief, Charmaine Sellings; her two volunteers, and one ute with a slip-on tank. They will have to fill the ute out of the water from her daughters pool, Sellings says, unless the power and water is switched back on. Their second fire truck was comandeered by the local CFA, of which Sellings is a volunteer, to fight fires north of Lakes Entrance. 
Theres a lot of fuel, its really dry, most of the dams are dry, and our water has gone on the blink again, Sellings says.
The community is cut off from the Princes Highway by a broad stretch of forest, which turns into farmland about 2km from the settlement. The community began as a church mission in 1863 and Lake Tyers residents were granted the freehold in 1971, under the Aboriginal Lands Act. Many residents were born on the mission, and its a haven for many other Koori, Suzie Squires, the CEO of the local housing corporation, says. 
Their last visit from emergency services was on Sunday, Sellings says. They have received no further information other than what was listed on the VicEmergency app, and watched the flames at Nowa Nowa on Monday night knowing they were only 8km away and not knowing whether they would get close. Sellings biggest concern is the health of elderly residents, many of whom have respiratory problems. 
If the fire is blown towards them and reaches the community centre, Kerry Tregonning says, they plan to take to the water.
We have got the boats out the back we can use to accomodate about 20 people, we have 20 life jackets for everyone to evacuate if we have to go to the water, Tregonning says. We are trying to source more life jackets now.
If fire does reach the forest surrounding the community, evacuation by water will be the only option.

'You won't put these fires out'

The Victorian emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, was just asked about resources for firefighters:

I think what was demonstrated when these fires came through and when the change happened overnight on Monday, you will not stop these fires. 
What we talk about, when you start to get ratings into the extreme area, fires are fast moving, uncontrollable, unpredictable. 
You wont put them out. Thats a fact. 
That is why in the lead-up to Monday, thats why we were putting out that messaging. 
We drew a line on a map. 
We said that people were in danger and we wanted people to be out of that particular area. 
So you are not going to put those fires out, not going to put the fires out now. It was nature which started the fires and it will be nature that stops these fires.

So there you have it  a unique and complex set of circumstances in Victoria  people isolated in the middle of fire grounds, people displaced by the fire and unable to return to their communities, and existing fires joining up to create bigger fires. Firefighters being brought in by air.
Five Australian states have been impacted by this fire season. Its not like the previous fire seasons that have scarred the landscape and the nations consciousness  fast-moving fires that devastated one particular area  this is hitting everything at once.

Updated at 2.13am GMT


 1.48am GMT 

The emergency commissioner finishes with this:

Weve got a huge team doing absolutely everything to keep everyone safe, from our firefighters and emergency services on the ground. 
You heard mention of the Red Cross, the Victorian Council of Churches, the government departments, the wonderful people working in the regional, state control centres  were focused on keeping communities safe from existing and potential fires we might see, but also to support our communities that are now heavily impacted.


Updated at 2.14am GMT


 1.47am GMT 

And on the additional Australian Defence Force support, Andrew Crisp says:

When we forecast what could have happened on Monday and Tuesday, we did some thinking and planning in relation if we had isolated communities. 
One of the requests we put to Emergency Management Australia and the ADF was about, if we had isolated communities on the coast, how will we get them out, if we dont have road access? 
One way would be by air, but as we know, smoke can be an issue and the other way would be by sea. 
As a result of that theres been a commitment from the Australian Defence Force to move naval assets towards Mallacoota. 
Similarly theyre moving in some larger helicopters  two Black Hawks will arrive in East Sale this afternoon and a larger Taipan later today. 
Those two Black Hawks will be able to fly later today until 8.30 and then they rest. They give us additional capability. 
Theyre able to fly at night. 
Although not dropping water on fires at night, that will give us a great intelligence capability overnight. 
Along with that, there will be two of the large Chinooks, so the heavy-lift helicopters coming from Townsville, and they will be here on Friday. 
So a significant ADF contingent based in East Sale, supporting the efforts in this part of the state. 
We know weve got a long way to go with this.


Updated at 2.17am GMT


 1.46am GMT 

On supplies and resources, Andrew Crisp says:

So what were doing in terms of assets, weve moved some of our bigger helicopters and as you heard from the premier, we will use some of those helicopters for a shift change of firefighters in and out of Mallacoota today. 
We will also be using the helicopters to get into communities, so we can listen to what they need.
We know, for example, with Mallacoota, we know they have a significant amount of water, but we know we need to get supplies to them. 
There was a police boat that came down from New South Wales yesterday. It brought in a small amount of water, but it was a nice touch to show were all in this together.
The Victoria police water police, a boat should have gone in taking 1.6 tonnes of water. Again, at about this time, were loading up a large barge in Melbourne.
It will have food and water and 30,000 litres of fuel. It will be making its way to Mallacoota. It will have supplies for about two weeks. 


Updated at 2.18am GMT


 1.44am GMT 

Andrew Crisp:

At this stage it looks like we have a fire danger rating of very high across the whole state. We might have some of the weather districts up to severe. 
Saturday is a significant day for us. Its about what we do to enable us to be in the best position we can to Saturday. 
If we get a run of new fires, we will find that they will be travelling down and they will join up with the East Gippsland fires. 
What we saw with the Mallacoota fire also, it took a run last night and theres a finger of that fire thats pushed over the border along the highway into New South Wales. 
So it is dynamic, theres a lot going on. Were focused on the fire. Our primary responsibility is to protect communities and to save lives. 
At the same time, seeing as we had such significant fires, equally important for us is the support we provide community. What we do in terms of supporting those isolated communities. 
So were very, very focused on that. 


Updated at 2.21am GMT


 1.43am GMT 

Andrew Crisp:

Along with those structural losses up in that particular fire, weve been made aware theres potentially significant stock losses and fencing and pasture and everything that goes with that.
Its not just about houses, its also about those parts of local business, of the agricultural sector, that are so important.
Thats their pasture. Weve got those fires up in the north-east.
Weve got the going fires down here, in East Gippsland. What weve seen over the last 24 hours is a significant number of lightning strikes up in the alpine regions, so Mount Hotham, Mount Bulla, into Jamieson.
Across the state, the last time I looked, we had more than 45 fires going  a lot of the new fires in that part of the state.
We are doing absolutely what we can to round as many up as quickly as we can. Were warming up into Friday and then what we term as spike days  Saturday is looking like a high-risk day for us again.


Updated at 1.50am GMT


 1.42am GMT 

The emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is now giving the nuts and bolts update of the fire situation on the ground:

We have three months of hot weather to come. We do have a dynamic and a dangerous fire situation across the state. 
What weve seen up to this point of time is more than 500,000 hectares burned in Victoria predominantly in the East Gippsland area. 
With the East Gippsland fires, we know that basically what we used to talk about as three fires have become one. 
You add that Mallacoota fire into the mix, and theres a significant amount of fire activity across all of East Gippsland. 
What we have up in the north-east of the state, what were referring to as the Corryong fires a fire that started on the other side of the border and then on that hot northerly, travelled down and impacted on an area where we believe we lost 10-15 structures and moved into Corryong and past there. 
Some great work to basically save the town of Corryong, and some additionally great work to open up that road quickly, that enabled a convoy of 68 vehicles to get people out of Corryong. 
Our concerns in the Corryong area, another fire started in NSW, further east. Its been travelling in a southerly direction.
The Corryong fire is over 100,000 hectares, the other fire is about 98,000 hectares. 
Theres the potential for them to come together today.

This now and in the weeks and months ahead. This is still very dangerous, it is changing ever, it is complex.

Mallacoota firefighters to be choppered in and out

Daniel Andrews gives some examples of how firefighters are having to work differently, because of the complex set of circumstances:

This will be an active fire and a very challenging and complex environment for weeks and therefore we have to do things differently.
For instance, today, I dont know that weve ever done this before, using Victorian assets, weve got choppers taking 90 firefighters out of the Mallacoota area, they cant be removed any other way  were essentially doing a shift change by the air.
Weve never done that before, getting firefighters that are essentially isolated in that Mallacoota community out and fresh teams going in. 
Thats not something weve done before, its one example of how complex and how challenging these East Gippsland fires are now and will be for a considerable period of time.


Updated at 1.43am GMT


 1.36am GMT 

Daniel Andrews:

The first point I want to make is that this is a particularly unique set of circumstances. Weve got people that are isolated in the middle of the fire, weve got people who have left and cant get back in. 
Weve got fires that are not out. 
We have got some very significant weather coming our way on Friday and Saturday. 
That makes this a long and dangerous and complex fight, a long and dangerous process to support everyone whos been impacted by it. 
I want to thank the community and thank everybody whos been touched by these fires for the patience theyve shown, for the way they look out for, for the fact they understand this is not like other bushfires where we had fires move through a devastated community, the fire is out and then you begin the next process of recovery and rebuilding. 
This is very different to that.

We know that the fire has impacted right along the coast. Weve got so many beautiful coastal villages. 
We dont know the full extent of the property damage. 
We know that there are building impact assessment teams out there now, both in that area and in the Shoalhaven. 
This fire is so big now that its broken up into two different emergency centres. It is massive. There has been devastating impact for people. 
But I just want to say that our community has been fantastic in supporting our volunteer firefighters and all our emergency services workers and volunteers.

Police confirm man's body found near Conjola

Here is a statement from NSW police confirming the tragic news that a body has been found at Yatte Yattah, west of Lake Conjola. It takes the death toll this week to four following the deaths of two men at Cobargo and a volunteer firefighter near Albury.

Police have confirmed a third man has died in bushfires impacting the states south coast.
About 7.30am today (Wednesday 1 January 2020), officers from South Coast Police District were informed the body of a man had been located in a burnt-out car on a road off the Princes Highway at Yatte Yattah, about 6km west of Lake Conjola.
The man has not been formally identified.
A report will be prepared for the information of the coroner.
Meanwhile, a 72-year-old man remains unaccounted for at Belowra, about 50km north west of Cobargo.
As the bushfire emergency continues, people are urged to obey direction of emergency services and to monitor the Rural Fire Service NSW website www.rfs.gov.au and www.livetraffic.com for road closures.
Emergency services are also reminding the community not to contact Triple Zero (000) unless there is an emergency.
If you are concerned about a loved one in a bushfire impacted area, visit https://register.redcross.org.au. 
Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers: 1800 333 000 or https://nsw.crimestoppers.com.au. Information is treated in strict confidence. The public is reminded not to report crime via NSW police social media pages.

What we know so far


At least three people have died in NSW, while another person remains unaccounted for in that state. 
In addition, Nine News reported in the past 10 minutes that a body had been found west of Conjola.
Authorities in Victoria hold grave fears for four people after fires tore through large swathes of East Gippsland yesterday.
The two men killed in fires at Cobargo yesterday have been named as Patrick Salway and his father, Robert Salway.
Its expected hundreds of homes have been destroyed on the NSW south coast, though the RFS says it is still conducting assessments. The ABC reported 50 properties lost in the town of Conjola Park.
Victorian authorities say about 50 properties have been lost across Buchan, Sarsfield and Mallacoota, but that figure is expected to rise.
More than 100 fires are burning in NSW, but conditions have eased and all fires have been downgraded to watch and act level.
Three fires are burning at emergency level in Victoria as dozens burn across the east and north-east.
Firefighters in NSW are using the improved conditions to contain existing fires and prepare for Saturday, which is tipped to rival yesterdays fire danger levels.

Greens call for royal commission into bushfire crisis

The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has issued a statement describing the bushfire crisis as a moment of truth for Scott Morrison. 
Im going to reproduce parts of it below for you, but the key point is that the Greens want a royal commission into the bushfire crisis. 
Di Natale said: Our hearts go out to those who have lost their lives and property in this latest tragedy and for the huge ecological damage and loss of native and domestic animals.
He said Scott Morrison should immediately convene an emergency summit, as proposed by former fire chief Mullins, to ensure that everything is being done to address the immediate crisis. 
But he also said: We must also accept that Australias climate has changed and we need to make sure that our land management, disaster response and climate policies are relevant to the new reality we face.

That is why the Greens are calling on the prime minister to immediately declare a royal commission into the bushfire crisis. If he refuses to do so, we will be moving for a parliamentary commission of inquiry with royal commission-like powers as soon as parliament returns.


While we need a national response to the bushfire crisis, any process that does not have at its heart a commitment to phase out fossil fuels like coal and rapidly transition to a renewable energy economy is doomed to fail from the start.

However, the town of Mallacoota will remain cut off. Youll remember about 4,000 people were taking shelter on the beach yesterday as fires tore through the area.
Police say they will be taking a boat with four paramedics and water into the town. Later, there will be a larger barge that will bring food, fuel and other supplies to the residents who remain hunkered down there. 
The Australian Defence Force will also arrive later with Black Hawk helicopters to drop off supplies.

The house doesnt come above my ankles, he says. It is totally destroyed.
Nicholls runs a short-stay accommodation business and native flower farm from his 55-acre (22-hectare) property.

 I want to share some of the footage I manage to take whilst defending my families property in Goongerah - Victoria. My father and I took a side of the house each, fighting off the embers that managed to spread incredibly fast straight up the hill we live on. The damage that was done to our property is insane, absolutely everything is burnt, we lost a few shacks and other bits and pieces out the back but saved the house, shed, our cars, tanks and some-f*cking-how the garden. It was a long hard fight through thick smoke, starting around 6.30, and by 11.30 we were settling down trying to sleep. We watched the fires take off south toward our other home in Orbost, only 80km away.... so to everyone out there who are under threat, get out of you can, stay safe, keep hydrated, and just bloody take care!!! It was absolute hell. @gopro     #australianfires #bushfire #vicfires #2019fires #australiafires #goongerah #orbost

Electricity and communications lines were cut for extended periods in many areas. Roads in and out of towns remain closed. The disaster has brought out stories of community and efforts to battle on in the face of unprecedented adversity in Victoria and NSW. In Bairnsdale, donations flooded in for those who had lost everything, who even then were reluctant to accept help.

A burnt-out truck on the Princes Highway south of Nowra, New South Wales, on Wednesday. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian   Crisp said it would not be possible to put out those fires before the weather worsened. It was nature which started the fires and it will be nature that stops these fires, he said. On Wednesday afternoon two fires burning on Kangaroo Island in South Australia merged, and firefighters have warned it could burn for weeks. Forecast northerly winds could push the fire towards the Flinders Chase national park. Since the start of July, 15 people have been killed by the bushfires and more than 1,000 homes lost. Firefighter Sam McPaul, 28, died when his fire truck was overturned by extreme winds east of Albury on Monday. Father and son, Robert and Patrick Salway, were found dead inside their house in Cobargo on Tuesday. The nature and scale of this bushfire season in Australia is unprecedented. Scientists have cited the lack of moisture in the landscape  following years of drought  as a key reason the fires have been so severe. Intense heat, dry conditions and strong winds have created conditions where the fire risk is considered extreme or catastrophic. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, at a reception for the Australian and New Zealand cricket sides at Kirribilli House, acknowledged the fires were a time of great challenge for Australia. Morrison reiterated comments from a New Year comment piece that focused on the resilience of communities and deflected debate about the underlying cause of the fires. Whether theyre started by lightning storms or whatever the cause may be, our firefighters and all of those who have come behind them to support them, whether theyre volunteering in the front line or behind the scenes in a great volunteer effort, it is something that will happen against the backdrop of this Test match. But at the same time, Australians will be gathering, whether its at the SCG [Sydney cricket ground] or around television sets all around the country, and theyll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think theyll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians and the way that people have gone about remembering the terrible things that other Australians are dealing with at the moment.","1166"

Following a dramatic decline in coal-fired power and a rise in renewable and low-carbon energy, 2019 was the cleanest year for electrical energy on record for Britain, according to National Grid, which owns and operates the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, and also runs the Scottish networks. National Grids latest data shows that wind farms, solar and nuclear energy, alongside energy imported by subsea cables, delivered 48.5% of Britains electricity in 2019. This compares to 43% generated by fossil fuels  coal, gas, and other carbon sources such as oil and diesel. The remaining 8.5% was generated by biomass, such as wood pellets. This milestone comes as the UK enters the mid-point between 1990 and 2050, the year in which it has committed to achieve at least a 100% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions based on 1990 levels, and to become a net zero carbon economy.  zero carbon winning  A decade ago, fossil fuels generated more than three-quarters of all electricity, while zero-carbon sources accounted for less than a quarter (22.8%), with wind at 1.3%. Then, coal plants provided almost a third of the UKs electricity. This has dwindled to 1.9%, and Britain set a new record for going without coal-powered energy altogether in summer 2019: it went for 18 days from May to early June without using coal to generate electricity, the longest such run since 1882. By the end of this winter, the UK will be left with only four coal fired power plants. EDF Energys Cottam coal plant in Nottinghamshire closed this year and two other coal plants, RWEs Aberthaw B and SSEs Fiddlers Ferry, are due to close in March 2020. The National Grid figures show a dramatic shift in the last two decades. Wind farms, solar panels and hydro power now generate just over a quarter of Britains electricity, compared with 2.3% in 1990. Nuclear power accounts for 17%, compared with nearly 20% in 1990. However, the use of gas  a fossil fuel  also shot up to generate more than 38% of the countrys electrical power last year, compared with just 0.1% in 1990. National Grids chief executive John Pettigrew said: As we enter a new decade, this truly is a historic moment and an opportunity to reflect on how much has been achieved. At National Grid, we know we have a critical role in the acceleration towards a cleaner future and are committed to playing our part in delivering a safe and secure energy system that works for all. Other recent government figures showed that the UKs growing fleet of offshore wind projects generated more electricity than onshore windfarms for the first time in the third quarter. Since then, wind power reached fresh highs during blustery weather in early December to generate almost 45% of the UKs electricity on one day. In December, National Grid unveiled plans to invest almost 10bn in the UKs gas and electricity networks over the next five years. Of this, almost 1bn has been earmarked for the transition to a net zero carbon electricity system by 2025, including investments in new equipment and technology. A further 85m will support changes to the ways people heat their homes, switching away from gas boilers to technologies such as electric heat pumps and hydrogen boilers. National Grid estimates that more than 23 million homes will need to install new low-carbon heating solutions by 2050.   This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to make clear, for avoidance of doubt, that various references to energy and power meant electricity only.","613"
"2020-01-01T08:00:01Z","world","World news","Western Balkans left 'betrayed' by EU over membership talks","The European Unions refusal to open membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania has left feelings of betrayal in the western Balkans, Croatia, which takes over the blocs rotating presidency on 1 January, has said. Gordan Grli Radman, the foreign minister of Croatia, which in 2013 became the last country to join the European Union, questioned whether the decision of EU leaders at a summit in October, led by France and backed by Denmark and the Netherlands, was correct and fair. The country, which is taking the EU presidency for the first time, is seeking to revive the EU dream for North Macedonia and Albania. North Macedonia had hoped to get approval to open membership talks after ending a 30-year dispute with Greece over its name. Albania, which filed an application to join the EU in 2009, had also hoped to start formal negotiations. Membership talks between these countries and the EU will take years. Both countries were told they had a future in the EU in 2003, but years of crisis and internal division inside the bloc, as well as the weakening rule of law in some member states, have dampened appetite for more members. Radman said North Macedonia had met all the preconditions. Now is it correct and fair? They made a lot of efforts, he said referring to the historic deal to change the countrys name, made with the assumption that EU and Nato membership would follow.  The people in North Macedonia were not happy with this change of name  And now the cold shower. They lost from all sides, they feel betrayed. North Macedonias foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, said the deal was a small miracle in this part of Europe and needs nurturing. He said the Croatian presidency could be a good chance for the discussion to get back on track. Croatia hopes EU leaders can reach agreement on reforming its enlargement process in March, prior to a summit between the EU and six western Balkan countries in May. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, insists the EU enlargement process should be overhauled to include a provision that countries can be required to redo earlier stages if there is any backsliding on commitments to the rule of law.  Radman said Croatia would be an honest broker, but also questioned whether it was fair to change the rules for countries that had begun talks under the existing system, such as Serbia and Montenegro. It is not possible to change the rules during the play, he said. The opening of accession agreements doesnt cost the European Union, contended Radman, an argument dismissed by Macron. Just to open negotiations: of course it does not mean they will become members tomorrow. Leaders of the EU institutions declared the decision of the leaders summit not to open accession talks as a historic mistake. Critics of Macrons approach have pointed to the growing influence of China, Turkey and Russia in the western Balkans and say that by stepping aside, the EU will allow other players to move in. A serious debate has now started, but the mood in the region is very depressed. Theres a general worry about whether enlargement is going to continue, or whether there will there be further obstacles at every step, said Florian Bieber, a political scientist at the University of Graz. Ruslan Stefanov, a director at the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia, said Macron had a point, that the EU needed to treat enlargement as a political, foreign policy challenge, not a technical process. There is a strong political angle to this accession process and this requires a much more assertive foreign policy on the side of the EU.  This meant, he said, that EU delegations in western Balkan candidate countries should be vocal on a daily basis if a government is failing to live up to its promises. If something happens that is not in line with what should be happening then we should say. We should not wait to say this in six months time in a report  We should say on the news locally. He said neither North Macedonia nor Albania could count on getting approval in the first part of the year, citing the troubled Franco-German relationship. Germany remains a strong advocate for EU enlargement in the Balkans, but was not able to convince France. I havent seen the chemistry between Berlin and Paris on this after the so-called historic mistake, Stefanov said. I havent seen the stars aligning, I havent seen much practical work. Bieber said Croatia was a supporter of accession for Albania and North Macedonia, but cautioned that the country has its own agenda when it comes to Bosnia and its own tensions with Serbia, so in that regard its got issues with its neighbours that dont make it easy to promote enlargement. Croatia will have support in its pro-enlargement agenda from Viktor Orbn, Hungarys far-right prime minister. Hungarys Olivr Vrhelyi is in charge of the enlargement portfolio in the new EU commission, and Orbn has long been an advocate of enlargement, favouring the EU admitting countries without making demands on democracy and rule of law. Its very important that in the upcoming period those of us who want enlargement give these countries our support, said Orbn, in a recent interview with Croatian media. Croatians and Hungarians agree that the European Union should admit as many countries as possible as rapidly as possible, according to uniform standards. This would not only benefit them, but also Croatia, Hungary and European security in general. ","928"
"2020-01-01T08:00:01Z","science","Science","International Space Station astronauts play with fire for research","Playing with fire can be dangerous and never more so than when confined in a space capsule floating 250 miles above the Earth. But in the past week astronauts onboard the International Space Station have intentionally lit a series of blazes in research designed to study the behaviour of flames in zero gravity. The scientists behind the experiment, called Confined Combustion, say it will help improve fire safety on the ISS and on future lunar missions by helping predict how a blaze might progress in low gravity conditions. Dr Paul Ferkul, of the Universities Space Research Association, who is working on the project, said: That is the immediate and most practical goal since Nasa can use the knowledge to improve material selection and fire safety strategies. On Earth, gravity pulls colder denser air down to the base of the flame, displacing hot air, which rises. This process feeds fresh oxygen to the fire and the upward flow of hot air gives the flame its characteristic teardrop shape. In zero gravity, flames can be spherical, or can be elongated by external flows of air. The latest experiments are not the first to set things ablaze inside the ISS, but are studying the process in more detail. Removing gravity eliminates natural convection; the hot air isnt going up because there is no up, said Ferkul who is working on the project with Professor Ya-Ting Liao of Case Western Reserve University. Instead the experiments, which began on Christmas Eve, involve a fan blowing air through the box to provide oxygen. The experiments are testing two fuels  fabric comprised of cotton and fibreglass, and clear acrylic plastic sheets  and testing how different air flows and sizes of box alter the combustion rates. The fires are lit inside a box within a box, to ensure safety. In the 15 experiments conducted so far the flame has burned for between one and 22 minutes. According to Ferkul, the astronauts love getting to burn stuff. They really enjoy the experiments because theyre so hands on, he said. We get to talk to the astronauts while theyre doing it. Previous work by the same team has revealed that, contrary to expectations, some materials would be more flammable on the moon due to the lower buoyancy. This is because for some materials, the convection flow is so fast that it extinguishes the flame on Earth. However, when transferred to the moon, the flow could hit a sweet spot where it is fast enough to draw in fresh oxygen but not so fast that the fire is blown out. The experiments are designed to provide better predictions of how different materials behave in low gravity environments. Living on the moon is a different environment from space station and Earth, and fires will behave differently there, said Ferkul. Theres reason to believe that fires could be more dangerous on the moon than on Earth. The experiments could also give new insights into the basic science of combustion, such as the chemistry of soot formation and how gas radiates from flames. The equations become significantly easier if we get rid of buoyancy, said Ferkul. We can look at some of the underlying physics that is sometimes masked by buoyancy. Soot is a very difficult thing to unravel.","545"

A moment of indecision over what podcast to listen to next  more Brexit analysis or another gruesome cold case centred on a womans corpse?  and I was sucked in. Now, I mainline two or three a day. But at least if the problem becomes unmanageable, someone will have a solution to offer me. For my entire adult life, I have not merely scoffed at but actively militated against the self-help industry. On a macro-level, I resented the simplicity of the solutions on offer, seeing them as capitalist sops designed to winkle out their victims weaknesses and create a cycle of cash-rich dependency. On a personal level, they offended my carefully nurtured, aggressively deployed intellectual defences; where I would bring Proust, they brought a Hallmark card. How stupid did people have to be to sign up to their vacuous bullshit?   Related: Stressed Brits buy record number of self-help books   But life moves on. It was a chance exchange on Twitter that began it: a writer I like and respect recommending a podcast that dealt with weight loss to one of her followers. I tracked it down; it was good, sensible, interested in the emotional causes of overeating and calamitous yo-yo dieting, entirely nonjudgmental. But it was also a million miles from any aural aesthetic I would normally gravitate to  upbeat, California, determined. And its host, the fantastically named Brooke Castillo, with her theories of how to bypass the busy, naysaying part of your brain and engage the bit that knows whats best for you, has a strategy for everything: shedding the pounds, cutting back on the booze, making gazillions, organising your sock drawer, building a windfarm in your back garden (OK, not that one, but I bet shes working on it). In they drop, these little bursts of can-do, must-do, will-do enthusiasm, once a week, all tied up by Brooke  whos known hard times, let me tell you  enjoining you to have a wonderful week while shes walking her dogs. I listened to her entire back catalogue, and then began to venture more broadly into the world of the motivational, seeking out experts in all manner of things that might ail you. I would not say I was a woman with problems; not unless you count poor impulse control, specifically in relation to red wine and rich cheese, a reluctance to exercise, a tendency to procrastinate when faced with anything involving a degree of uncertainty (tax returns, thank you letters, travel arrangements and, most worryingly for my chosen profession, writing), separation anxiety, attachment anxiety, unpredictable attacks of nameless dread. The usual. Amazingly, my lifelong devotion to literature, despite its ability to look deep into the human heart, has not yielded much in the way of targeted five-point plans. Nor, apparently, do these issues melt away as the years accrue; rather, bad and self-destructive habits appear to become more entrenched and guilt-ridden. But heres what made the difference: a simple decision not to fixate on whether these nuggets of basic, and occasionally schmaltzy, wisdom were rooted in the kind of philosophical and moral correctness for which I revere George Eliot, nor the delicate apprehension of human consciousness that I get from Virginia Woolf. But instead to ask: Might they help me to tackle my inbox or say no to an unwise extra glass? It turned out they did. I have no idea why, but somehow the messages I listened to while driving or making dinner or going to sleep seemed to take root and reappear at useful moments. And my other fear  that this level of what has come to be called self-care is just a cover for next-level narcissism  has also been unfounded. It turns out that when youre not waking up every day cringing at your own shortcomings, you have more time to spend turning your face out to the world.   Related: We've spent the decade letting our tech define us. It's out of control   The hunch that allows me to maintain a degree of brainy amour-propre is that the content of such self-help panaceas is only part of the deal. Perhaps the greater portion is the willingness to admit that ones imperfections can have their edges smoothed off without a full-scale psychodynamic investigation and consequent dark night of the soul. Perhaps someone else can chip in with a word of advice, a tactic, a regime. Perhaps those thorny areas can, like all those unused apps on your phone, be offloaded until theyre once again needed; and perhaps that will be never. So here I am, utterly incapable of solving the worlds problems, having sat beside enough hospital beds to know I cant turn back the tide of illness or mortality, still surrounded by piles of paperwork and still, sadly, in pursuit of the ability to jump up in the morning, walk five miles and eat a probiotic breakfast. But I have, in the mantra of one of my favourite podcasts, decided to rescind permission to be cruel to myself as a result of these failures. There will be a nice voice to tell me how I can go back to try again and reassure me I havent got it all wrong. And that, in these brutal times, is not nothing.

"2020-01-01T07:30:00Z","books","Books","Providence Lost by Paul Lay review – the rise and fall of Oliver Cromwell’s Protectorate","The only public execution of a British head of state occurred 371 years ago outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall on 30 January 1649. It was a radical, unintended act, born of failed negotiations and it entirely disregarded the people of Scotland and Ireland. The surviving details are piquant and shaming: Charles I in two shirts so as not to betray shivered fear on a cold day, a masked executioner in a wig and false beard, a collective groan from the crowd. This used to be the moment when the curtain dropped. After an interval, or interregnum, in which Oliver Cromwell assumed power and killed all joy, the Stuarts returned for the second act, Charles II: the merry monarch. His reign was backdated to his fathers death and an Act of Oblivion drew a line under the horrid business of republic and civil war. As Paul Lay demonstrates in his immensely stimulating study of Cromwells Protectorate, this simply will not do. This was one of the most extraordinary, exhilarating, innovative and anxiety inducing periods in British history. There is no better time to be looking at it. The providence of Lays title is the lodestone Protestant belief that God in his mystery had a hand in all things. Nothing could happen, not salvation, nor a sneeze, without divine direction. This made the hotter sort of Protestants, the Puritans, off-balance and twitchy for approval, like social media addicts, Lay observes. None was more hooked on providence than Cromwell, a yeoman farmer from Cambridgeshire (and kinsman of Henry VIIIs minister), who had risen through the ranks of the army to take effective charge of Whitehall and Westminster.    Portrait of Charles I by Anthony van Dyck. Photograph: De Agostini/Getty Images   Providence is also a volcanic island in the Caribbean and it is here that the book opens, on Christmas Eve 1629, with idealistic Puritans hoping to settle a godly colony. They failed, largely because they refused to trade with Spaniards, but the vision endured, as did its backers, including key players in the Long Parliament that went to war with the king. At the battles of Naseby, Marston Moor and the crowing mercy of Worcester, God blew and the royalists were scattered. Providence justified the abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords, just as it explained Cromwells clean sheet of victories. After his seemingly miraculous defeat of the Scots at Dunbar in 1650, he was seen laughing excessively as if he had been drunk; his eyes sparkled with spirits. Others thought he was high on hubris. In December 1653, having forcibly dissolved two parliaments, Cromwell accepted the title of Lord Protector, which was written into a constitution known as the Instrument of Government. It was resisted by the first protectorate parliament and so, in a constitutional contortion that might make even todays politicians blush, Cromwell dissolved parliament by counting its minimum period in lunar months, rather than the conventional, longer, calendar months. I speak for God and not for men, he told MPs. He was beginning to sound a lot like Charles I. Cromwells fundamental goal was liberty of conscience, but his challenge was to keep his army standing, deliver strong and stable government (healing and settling) and shape the people into a nation worthy of Christs imminent return. In that great gross line, he described the English as under circumcision, but raw. Above all, he strained to hear Gods voice once the guns had fallen silent. The answer, he decided, was global. He would take Gods fight back to the Caribbean, seize the island of Hispaniola, avenge the loss of Providence and return with enough bullion to pay the army. The expedition commander was so buoyed by the venture that it doubled as his honeymoon. He returned to Portsmouth almost a skeleton and was dispatched to the Tower of London. The Western Design was an abject failure. The subsequent conquest of Jamaica was a face-saving afterthought and, it would turn out, the inversion of liberty. In that crucial year, 1655, Cromwell also suppressed an ineffectual royalist rebellion. Spurred by John Lambert, the hero of Dunbar, he surmised that God would be placated by a clampdown on security and sin. England was divided into military districts. Former royalists had to register their movements and pay for the privilege in the form of a decimation tax. Vagrants were apprehended. Meetings at racecourses and bear-baiting rings, where conspiracies might fester, were dispersed. War was waged on fornication, drunkenness and gambling: wars unwinnable, Lay notes. In Altham, Lancashire, 200 unlicensed alehouses were closed within three months of the arrival of Major-General Worsley, a fundamentalist who drove himself to death in his maniacal pursuit of vice. The major generals lacked the resources to effect a moral reformation and were soon rejected by the electorate. It was, nevertheless, a dystopian time and not forgotten: No man in uniform has ruled Britain since Cromwell, Lay points out.    Charles II by John Michael Wright. Photograph: Dea Picture Library/De Agostini/Getty Images   Providence Lost is a learned, lucid, wry and compelling narrative of the 1650s as well as a sensitive portrayal of a man unravelled by providence. Lays Cromwell is dithering and ambiguous, too slippery to pin down, but almost likable, almost true. He welcomed Jews back to England, even if he aimed to convert them to Christianity (Sigmund Freud named his son Oliver). He regretted, on a personal and procedural level, the Commons retrospective judgment of James Nayler, a priapic, lank haired Quaker with messianic pretensions, who was branded for blasphemy and whipped until his back was a sheet of raw flesh. (One MP even mooted the obscure Roman punishment of stitching him into a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper and an ape, and tossing him into the river.) As Cromwell settled into his reign  an accurate enough word  he displayed shades of hypocrisy. Lascivious songs and stage plays were forbidden, but the elite could enjoy dancing and the first English opera. Cromwell dipped into Charles Is art collection and had a room at Hampton Court draped in sinful tapestries. And yet: when, in the wake of a royalist-leveller gunpowder plot in 1657, the issue of the succession led to parliament offering Cromwell the crown, he turned it down: I would not seek to set up that which providence hath destroyed.  On Cromwells death in 1658, the Protectorate passed to his son Richard, who had that rare gift in politics of realising when he was not up to the job. He did not resist when army radicals ousted him in May 1659. The following year, having lost any semblance of order or legitimacy, they too were gone. The Protectorate was too out of touch, too reliant on the sword and far too expensive to be missed. Its failure ensured that whichever randy prince might come along, monarchy would endure. Two contemporary works capture the contrasting tempers of the time. The Anglican Izaak Waltons The Compleat Angler is a fishing manual that rejoices in the beauty and bounty of the land. It reflects still waters and a contented patience beyond the ken of Puritanism. Lay doesnt discuss John Miltons Paradise Lost, but the title and its themes of tyranny and failed revolution shadow every page of his book. Milton gave his life to the Puritan cause and was crushed by its betrayal, but even when he went blind, he did not lose sight of liberty, or God. Paradise Lost closes with Adam and Eve wiping their tears and venturing out of Eden with providence their guide. It is an epic, eloquent scream into the cataclysm and a testament to the intellectual ferment of the republic, but it is the quiet little fishing book that has been reprinted more often.

In Paris, large crowds gathered to watch a light show at the Arc de Triomphe followed by a fireworks display at midnight. But the interesting number in the French capital was that Tuesday marked the 27th consecutive day of transport strikes against president Emmanuel Macrons plans to overhaul the French pension system. All metro lines in the French capital were closed except for two automatic lines, and only a few night buses were running.

And in case you missed it, Mariah Careys Twitter account was hacked this New Years Eve. 
The Guardians Andre Wheeler writes: 

Careys Twitter account shared numerous racist slurs and comments with the singers 21.4 million followers on the platform.
Its unclear whos behind the hack, and the pop star did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Most of the tweets published on Tuesday afternoon were quickly deleted. Many verged on the nonsensical and appeared to troll the singers fans. 

The hack comes at an interesting time. Carey has become a renewed focal point of pop culture in recent weeks, through her record-breaking achievements on the Billboard Chart.
The singers modern classic All I Want For Christmas hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time this month  25 years after its original release. And on Monday, Billboard announced Carey is projected to become the first artist to have number-one hits in four consecutive decades, when All I Want For Christmas tops the 4 January 2020 Hot 100 list.
Whats a decade? the singer jokingly tweeted after the news broke, when she was allegedly still in control of her account.

Pope! and Happy New Year! resounded as families rushed to catch a glimpse of him or thrust out their infant in hopes he would pat their heads or pinch their cheeks, the AP reports.
One woman grabbed the popes hand and pulled him toward her to shake it. Francis, 83, exclaimed and then struck the womans hand twice to free his hand.
At a New Years Eve Vespers service in St. Peters Basilica, Francis urged people to practice more solidarity and to build bridges, not walls.

Security officers in New York were on high alert on Tuesday evening, as revelers arrived to celebrate the new year in Manhattans Times Square. 
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said spectators should feel safe but encouraged them to remain vigilant and alert officers if they feel something is amiss.
Law enforcers were monitoring the situation with more than 1,000 security cameras, police helicopters and drones.
Several of the NYPDs drones are equipped with thermal-imaging and 3D-mapping capabilities and strong camera lenses that can greatly magnify a subject.
Streets in and around Times Square were closed to car traffic hours before the ball drop and police cars and sand-filled sanitation trucks were positioned to stop vehicles from driving into the crowd.

The city has been on edge this week following a string of attacks during Hanukah, but Tuesday celebrations may offer some relief. The AP reports: 

A Chinese dance performance, punctuated with red and gold pyrotechnics, will usher in a host of stars at Times Squares six-hour New Years Eve extravaganza.
The throng of revelers in the heart of Manhattan will get to see rap-pop star Post Malone, K-pop group BTS, country singer Sam Hunt and singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette during the big street party.
While giddiness will likely prevail at the televised event, some important global issues will be driven home, as well.
High school science teachers and students, spotlighting efforts to combat climate change, will press the button that begins the famous 60-second ball drop and countdown to next year.
Then comes the 3,000lb (1,360 kilograms) of confetti, accompanied by more pyrotechnics.

Heres PA Medias report on the firework display on the banks of the River Thames in central London:
Thousands of people lined the Thames as London kicked off the new decade to the roar of football anthems such as Three Lions with the festivities providing a prelude to the Euro 2020 football tournament.
Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, had promised the display  which also featured music from Stormzy, Wiley and Bastille  would be the best the capital has ever seen.
Big Ben rang out 12 times to mark the start of the new year despite the bell falling mostly silent in 2019 while renovation work is completed.
Londons annual New Years Eve fireworks display was sold out, with about 100,000 revellers packed into the streets around Victoria Embankment.
Around 2,000 fireworks set off during the display were fired from the London Eye, with the remainder coming from barges moored in a central location along the River Thames.
The show celebrated Londons role in hosting this summers international football tournament, which will take place in countries across the continent rather than being hosted by a single nation  and will see the capital host more fixtures than any other city.
Seven of the competitions matches are set to be played in the capital, with Wembley Stadium scheduled to host the final and semi-finals.
Footballs coming home blared out as the Baddiel, Skinner and Lightning Seeds favourite accompanied the spectacular show, followed by The White Stripes Seven Nation Army and classical hit Nessun Dorma.
Speaking in the city centre ahead of the celebrations on Tuesday night, Mr Khan told the PA news agency the world will be watching the display, and he hoped it would show London was a global city.
He said: Fairly or unfairly, people around the world saw the Brexit referendum vote as the UK somehow turning its back on the rest of the world, including Europe.
The fear was, we would become insular, inward-looking, and what Im keen to show is the opposite.
Yes we may be leaving the EU, but very much as a city we are still a European global city. We will continue to be open to peoples trade and ideas.
What tonights fireworks are about is demonstrating our confidence.
And its really important that we show the world who will be watching our fireworks that we are a confident, global, outward-looking European city.

The former directors of both the leave and remain campaigns in the EU referendum have joined cultural and religious leaders across the UK in an open letter calling for a decade of reconnection.
The letter, released on New Years Day, describes the 2010s as the decade of division, and says the country is polarised and more fragmented than any of us would like.
The heads of the British Olympic and Paralympic Associations, Scouts and Guides are among those calling for greater social integration and cohesion, and are encouraging Britons to make a new Years resolution to engage meaningfully with those around them.
Our resolution is to reconnect, the letter says. To reach out to just one person we dont know, or from whom we have drifted apart. To start rebuilding connections between neighbours and fellow citizens.

French president Emmanuel Macron somewhat provocatively used his traditional New Years Eve address to pledge that he would push through an overhaul of the pension system despite the country having grinded to a halt after weeks of nationwide strikes by trade unions.

The 42-year-old, who has faced a bruising year of protests including weekly demonstrations by the gilets jaunes movement which have frequently turned violent, said he expected his government to quickly find a compromise with unions on the reform, but that the original principles laid out by ministers would be adhered to.

The warming of our Earth is real. It is threatening. It and the crises arising from global warming were caused by humans, she said. So we must do everything humanly possible to deal with this challenge for humanity. That is still possible.

She acknowledged criticism both from people who are worried about being overburdened by the measures and from those who think they dont go far enough, but said they provide the necessary framework.
Its true that, at 65, I am at an age where I personally wont experience all the consequences of climate change that would arise if politicians didnt act, she said.
It is our children and grandchildren who will have to live with the consequences of what we do or dont do today, Merkel added. So I am putting all my energy into Germany making its contribution ecologically, economically, socially to getting a grip on climate change.
Europe must also raise its voice more strongly in the world, the four-term chancellor said, pledging to work for that during the EU presidency. She pointed to planned meetings with Chinese and African leaders.
Merkel, Germanys leader since 2005, has said that her current term will be her last.

We live in an eventful, dynamic and controversial time, but we must do everything to make sure Russia develops successfully, Putin said.
Only together can we solve the problems ahead for the country, for our society. Our unity is the foundation for accomplishing the highest of goals, he said.
Our personal plans and dreams are indivisible from Russias. Its present and future depend on the efforts and contributions of each of us.
Putin said he looked forward to celebrating the 75th anniversary of Russias World War II victory in 2020 and thanked veterans.
Moscow is planning to host world leaders during festivities on 9 May, one of Russias biggest official holidays.
An address to the nation from leaders in Moscow has been a tradition since the 1970s and is shown around midnight in Russias 11 time zones.

London mayor Sadiq Khan has promised tonights New Years Eve celebrations will feature the best fireworks London has ever seen in a statement that verged on the political and which will annoy his Brexiteer detractors.
The capital will project confidence on the world stage through the impressive display, Khan said. Hand on heart, these are going to be the best fireworks London has ever seen.
The mayor, a key opponent of Brexit, added that the world will be watching the display and he hoped it would show London was a global city.
He said: Fairly or unfairly, people around the world saw the Brexit referendum vote as the UK somehow turning its back on the rest of the world, including Europe.
The fear was, we would become insular, inward-looking, and what Im keen to show is the opposite.
Yes we may be leaving the EU, but very much as a city we are still a European global city. We will continue to be open to peoples trade and ideas.
What tonights fireworks are about is demonstrating our confidence.
And its really important that we show the world who will be watching our fireworks that we are a confident, global, outward-looking European city.
The theme of this years display will look ahead to the capital hosting several key games in the Euro 2020 football tournament.
The pyrotechnics show will feature more than 12,000 fireworks, with the display being set to a soundtrack inspired by London and Europe, according to a spokeswoman for the mayor.
The event has sold out after more than 100,000 tickets were snapped up, and travel on Transport for London (TfL) services will be free until 4.30am on 1 January.

And heres some more about events in Edinburgh. You may followed our reporting of the row over residents of the city having access to their own homes curtailed by the official celebrations. This seems to have been resolved but has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many worried about the over-commercialisation of Hogmanay.
Heres the Press Associations report on the evening so far in the Scottish capital:

Celebrations have begun in Edinburgh, as crowds gathered to witness the New Years Eve fireworks set to illuminate the skies above the citys street party.
The streets of Edinburgh are filling up as Hogmanay revellers prepare to welcome in the start of a new decade and enjoy the UKs biggest street party.
Performances from Idlewild, Rudimental and Marc Almond will take place on stages throughout the city centre, while DJ Mark Ronson will usher in the new year, creating a new soundtrack ahead of the clock striking 12.
Approximately 100,000 visitors are expected to attend the event, according to organisers who billed the Hogmanay celebrations as the UKs biggest New Years Eve street party.

TV stars Ant and Dec took to the stage in Princes Street Gardens early on Tuesday evening as crowds gathered, playing music and introducing the first firework display of the night.
Street theatre, circus acts and musical performances also took place up across more than a dozen streets, including the citys main throughfare Princes Street and its adjacent gardens, while ceilidhs danced their way into the night in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle.
There had been criticism of the events organisation, amid uncertainty around how many passes residents were allowed, with Underbelly  which also runs the Edinburgh Festival Fringe  accused of creating unnecessary confusion by the council leader.
The festivities began in the city on Monday as around 40,000 people joined a torchlit procession which culminated in them forming the shape of two humans reaching out a hand of friendship.
Leading the parade down the Royal Mile and into Holyrood Park was a 40-strong cast from Celtic Fire Theatre company PyroCeltica.

Security was tight in both cities and elsewhere in Britain after police arrested five men on suspicion of terrorism offences on Monday, but said the arrests were not related to the celebrations.
South Africa
Thousands gathered at Cape Towns Waterfront area to ring in the new year with music, dancing and fireworks in front of the citys iconic Table Mountain.
In past years, residents of Johannesburgs Hillbrow neighbourhood would celebrate the new year by tossing furniture, appliances and even refrigerators from the balconies of high-rise apartment buildings. Police have issued stern warnings and it appears the curious tradition has declined.
Rome
Pope Francis took a stroll in St Peters Square on Tuesday night to admire the Nativity scene. Shouts of Pope! Pope! and Happy new year! resounded as families rushed to catch a glimpse of him or thrust out their infant in hopes he would pat their heads or pinch their cheeks.

People flocked to temples and shrines in Japan, offering incense with their prayers to celebrate the passing of a year and the the first new year of the Reiwa era.
Under Japans old-style calendar, Reiwa started in May after Akihito stepped down and his son Naruhito became emperor. Although Reiwa is entering its second year with 2020, January 1 marks Reiwas first new years day, the most important holiday in Japan.

Inevitably, the crossing into the new year saw protests break out in Honk Kong, which police moved to suppress by firing tear gas volleys just minutes into 2020. 
Pro-democracy protesters took their movement into the new year with midnight countdown rallies and a massive march planned for January 1.
The city has been battered by more than six months of unrest with marches attended by millions, as well as confrontations in which police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets  and protesters have responded with petrol bombs.
Before midnight on Tuesday, thousands of protesters gathered across the financial hub, including along the waterfront of Victoria Harbour and at nightlife hotspot Lan Kwai Fong. Protesters at the harbour front counted down chanting Ten! Nine! Liberate Hong Kong, revolution now! as they lit up their phones in a sea of lights.
Smaller crowds of protesters in the Mong Kok district set fire to barricades  and riot police unleashed 2020s first tear gas cannisters in response.
Earlier police had used water cannon to disperse protesters in the same area while, in nearby Prince Edward neighbourhood, officers arrested several protesters staging a candlelight vigil.

Many in the country will use the opportunity to hold protests against a citizenship law, despite prime minister Narendra Modis attempts to dampen demonstrations that have run for nearly three weeks, according to Reuters.
The country has been rocked since 12 December, when Modis government passed legislation easing the way for non-Muslim minorities from the neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain Indian citizenship.
Many Indians fear the move will discriminate against the minority Muslim community and chip away at the countrys secular constitution.
Protesters plan demonstrations in New Delhi, including the area of Shaheen Bagh, where hundreds of residents have blocked a major highway for 18 days.
Poetry recitals and speeches are planned by organisers at a protest outside the capitals Jamia Millia university, which was stormed by police this month.
New Years resolution to defend the constitution, read the schedule for another protest planned in New Delhi, now in the grip of its second coldest winter in more than a century.
Police said they planned to deploy additional forces in New Delhi on New Years Eve, with traffic curbs imposed in some parts of the capital.
All precautionary measures are in place, said police official Chinmoy Biswal, who oversees the southeastern part of the city that includes Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia University.
Recently, there have been no incidents. So we hope things will remain fine, he told Reuters.

With just under 12 hours to go before New Year there, people have been filing into New Yorks Times Square, which the citys counterterrorism czar says will probably be the safest place on the planet Earth on New Years Eve.
Thousands of police officers will be on duty for Tuesday nights festivities, along with specialized units armed with long guns, bomb-sniffing dogs and other measures.
For the first time, police drones are expected to keep watch over the big, confetti-filled celebration a year late after rain grounded the departments unmanned eye-in-the-sky last year.
This years forecast calls for some clouds, but no rain and none of the bitter cold that iced out spectators two years ago.
The NYPDs Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Counterterrorism, John Miller, said stacking various security tools and techniques gives police multiple chances to catch something coming through.
Times Square is probably going to be the safest place on the planet Earth on New Years Eve because nobody else puts that kind of effort into an event like this, Miller said.
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said there are no specific, credible threats to the event, which brings hundreds of thousands of people to midtown Manhattan and attracts millions of TV viewers. Post Malone, BTS and Alanis Morissette are scheduled to perform on stages in the heart of Times Square.

The New Year is being celebrated in countries including Thailand and Vietnam. Tens of thousands of revelers in Indonesias capital of Jakarta were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for New Years Eve fireworks.
Festive events along coastal areas near the Sunda Strait were meanwhile dampened by a possible larger eruption of Anak Krakatau, an island volcano that erupted last year just ahead of Christmas Day, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 430 people.
The countrys volcanology agency has warned locals and tourists to stay 2 kilometers (1.3 miles) from the volcanos crater following an eruption Tuesday that blasted ash and debris up to 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) into the air.

Global stock markets have posted their best year since the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago, as US technology investors and shares in eurozone and Asia-based companies drove a worldwide rally.
The MSCI World Index, which tracks stocks across the developed world, jumped by almost 24% during 2019  the strongest performance since 2009.
London fared relatively badly compared to other markets in 2019, however. The S&P 500 index of top US companies has surged by 28% this year, hitting a series of record highs, as Donald Trumps tax cuts, share buybacks and optimism about US growth prospects boosted markets in the worlds largest economy. The tech-dominated Nasdaq index, whose stocks include Netflix, Facebook and Amazon, posted a rise of 35% over the year  with Apple leading the way by surging 84%.
Eurozone stocks also outperformed, with Germanys Dax and Frances CAC both up 25%. Japans Nikkei gained 18%, helped by the prospect of new stimulus by Shinzo Abes government.

Williams adds that Kim Jong Un is expected to make new year address later on as usual and is likely to announce his intentions regarding next steps in relation to North Koreas fraught relationship with the US and neighbours.
State media reported earlier this week that the North Korean leader had called for positive and offensive measures to ensure security at a ruling party meeting ahead of a year-end deadline he has set for denuclearisation talks with the United States.

From Notre Dames spire collapsing in flames to sled dogs wading through Greenlands melted ice water and Stormzy triumphant at Glastonbury  photographers have been recalling how they captured some of the defining images of the year. 
It includes a recollection from Jorge Guerrero of the haunting photo he took of people being rescued of the coast of Malaga after an an inflatable boat carrying 132 migrants was rescued by the Spanish coastguard in the Alboran Sea.

Guerrero added:

The reason they make the journey to Europe is complex, but it is often because of extreme poverty, exploitation and conflict in their countries of origin. You see in their faces, tiredness, despair and at the same time an expression of hope. Every time I photograph immigration, I feel sadness.

In Japan, which has just been celebrating the arrival of 2020, people have been flocking to temples and shrines, offering incense with their prayers to celebrate the passing of a year and the first new year of what is known as the Reiwa era.
Under Japans old-style calendar, linked to emperors rules, Reiwa started in May, after Emperor Akihito stepped down and his son Naruhito became emperor.
Although Reiwa is entering its second year with 2020, 1 January still marks Reiwas first new year, the most important holiday in Japan.
We have a new era and so I am hoping things will be better, although 2019 was also a good year because nothing bad happened, said Masashi Ogami, 38, who ran a sweet rice wine stall at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo, told the Associated Press news agency
Other stalls sold fried noodles and candied apples, as well as little figures and amulets in the shape of mice, the zodiac animal for 2020. Since the Year of the Mouse starts off the Asian zodiac, it is associated with starting anew.

In London, those attending a New Years Eve party hosted by the couple who changed the law to allow mixed-sex couples in England and Wales to form civil partnerships are being invited to bring the food that they love to cook or makes them feel loved up.
Earlier today, I went to Chelsea Town Hall to report on how they joined thousands of others who have been entering into the new form of legal unions today.
Today, as one decade ends and another dawns, we become civil partners in law, Steinfeld, 38, said outside the building. Our personal wish to form a civil partnership was rooted in our desire to formalise our relationship in a more modern way, focus on equality, and mutual respect.
So today is a unique, special and personal moment for us, a moment that weve been able to affirm our love and commitment to one another in the company of our beautiful children, Eden and Ariel, and close friends.
Following Steinfeld and Keidans victory at the supreme court in 2018, it is expected that as many as 84,000 ceremonies will be conducted in 2020 as couples take advantage of a right originally legislated for LBTQI couples.

Hong Kongs tourism board has been in touch to share details of what has been planned for the new year celebrations in less than an hour, when the citys Victoria Harbour will take centre stage.
An enhanced edition of one of the worlds largest light and music shows  A Symphony of Lights  is set to ring in 2020 with a kaleidoscope of lighting effects..
A minute before midnight the faade of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) will turn into a giant clock to count down to the new year. Once the clock strikes midnight, an enriched version of the multimedia show, A Symphony of Lights, will commence, according to the tourism board.
In addition to lasers, searchlights, LED screens and other lighting effects at numerous harbour-front buildings, the new year countdown special edition will be synchronised with pyrotechnics launched from building rooftops and the display of 2020 on the faade of the HKCEC.

Protesters block road in Hong Kong

Reuters is reporting that thousands of protesters briefly blocked one of Hong Kongs main roads after forming human chains across the city, urging people not to give up the fight for democracy in 2020.
The protesters fled when police came to clear the road of objects such as umbrellas, street furniture and the metal skeleton of a Christmas tree decoration but then occupied other parts of the road. At least one man was arrested.
Authorities have cancelled the popular midnight fireworks for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns. A Symphony of Lights is planned instead, involving projections on to the citys tallest skyscrapers after a countdown to midnight.
Tuesday began with small-scale lunchtime rallies, followed by marches through several prime shopping malls and giant human chains in various districts across the city.
 On Nathan Road, an important artery on the Kowloon peninsula, protesters in a chain stretching for several kilometres raised lit-up smartphones as passing cars and buses honked in support and tourists in party hats and 2020-shaped glasses took pictures. Many protesters held up cards reading Lets keep fighting together in 2020.
The chain later spilled over into the road, and some protesters built barricades and hid behind umbrellas, blocking traffic.

It is nearly midnight in much of Australia (in cities like Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra).
Tens of thousands of Victorians have gathered in Melbourne to enjoy an early new year celebration, reports the Australian Associated Press.

As the city darkened and the weather settled near 20C, families gathered next to Melbourne cricket ground to watch movies, listen to music and witness an early seven-minute firework show that will serve as an appetiser for the midnight show.
Police heavily secured the surrounding area. Many officers relaxedly patrolled the streets and walkways, takings pictures with some of the attendees.
More than 500 security guards, 118 marshals and 22 area wardens are employed for the celebration, which has five kilometres of fencing across the city.
Along the Yarra River bend, skaters spent the last hours of the night practising their tricks while groups of friends secured a spot to watch the spectacular fireworks that will fill the city with light at midnight.
More than 14 tonnes of fireworks will be used for the City of Melbournes show, called Reach for the Stars.
The city council says New Years Eve 2019 will help raise funds for the Salvation Army emergency services responding to bushfires in Victoria, NSW, Queensland and Western Australia.

Preparations are under way in Edinburgh for its Hogmanay festival amid a row over the rights of residents in the citys centre to access their homes.
The leader of Edinburgh council, Adam McVey, has accused Underbelly, the events company that runs Edinburghs winter and Hogmanay festivals, for the dispute over access rights for people who live within the large security zone covered by the festival.
The row erupted last week after it emerged that the festivals organisers had said applications by residents for any more than six access passes would be screened by the police. This is from the Guardians Scotland editor, Severin Carrell.

About 75,000 revellers are expected to converge on the Hogmanay festival site, called the arena by Underbelly, for performances featuring Mark Ronson, Marc Almond and other acts spread over several stages.
Residential and shopping areas such as Rose Street, Princes Street, Mound Place, Castle Street, Frederick Street and Hanover Street will be cordoned off with steel barriers and security checks.
One of its biggest events is the Hogmanay fireworks display from Edinburgh Castle. But residents inside the zone will be barred from viewing it at street level unless they have bought festival tickets.
To the anger of community groups, Underbelly also suggested that if residents wanted larger numbers of access passes for their own Hogmanay parties, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service would be asked to check that was within safety limits for their property.

As 2019 draws to a close, we want to find out your hopes, dreams and desires for the next decade.


The 2010s have provided the world with an array of defining challenges: from the rise in political populism to the fight against the climate emergency. There have been huge people movements from the Arab spring to Black Lives Matter, MeToo and the Global climate strikes.
It was a defining decade for LGBTQ people from the very start, with Argentina legalising same-sex marriage and communities grappling with how gender should be constructed.
The advancement of tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon has dramatically altered how people connect with media and each other.
In the UK, love it or hate it, Brexit, became one of the most defining moments of British political history.
In such complex and turbulent times it is almost impossible to know what the future holds for us all. Nonetheless, we want to know what you hope the future will bring  also what you expect to see more of and any solutions you think may work.

Sydneys New Years Eve fireworks became contentious this year as the country faces an unprecedented bushfire crisis. With 100 fires burning in New South Wales and a total fire ban across Sydney, more than 275,000 people signed a petition calling for the fireworks to be cancelled and the money donated to fire relief. But authorities insisted the money had already been spent and signalled the event generates $130m for the NSW economy. 
The states fire service granted an exemption from the fire ban for Sydneys fireworks while many other events around the state had to be cancelled. Sydneys lord mayor said the council had already donated $620,000 to bushfire and drought-affected communities and the broadcast of the event would also act as a fundraiser for further relief money.

"2020-01-01T07:01:57Z","business","Business","UK music purchases hit highest level since 2006","British fans bought or streamed the equivalent of more than 150m albums last year as music consumption in the UK hit its highest level since 2006, driven by the success of artists including Lewis Capaldi, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande. Across all formats  including digital downloads and streams from subscription services as well as CDs, vinyl and cassettes  music fans purchased or streamed the equivalent of 154m albums in 2019. This is the most since music consumption hit the equivalent of 161.4m albums in 2006. Lewis Capaldi was the most streamed artist of the year, with his album Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent and the single Someone You Loved topping the charts. In 2006 the bestselling album was Snow Patrols Eyes Open, and Gnarls Barkleys Crazy was the top selling single.  charts  The annual report from the music industry body the BPI highlights the extent to which the rise of legal streaming services from Spotify and Apple to Amazon and Deezer continue to be the salvation of artists. Sales of the once mighty CD plummeted 26.5% to 23.5m last year, less than half the number sold just three years ago, to account for just 15% of the total. Meanwhile the equivalent of 114m albums of music were streamed this year, an uplift of more than a quarter compared with 2018, as consumer habits continue to drive the music industry from a physical to a digital listening experience. Music fans listened to a record 114bn tracks on streaming services last year, with every 1,000 tracks streamed considered to be the equivalent of one real-world album sale. Streaming accounted for three-quarters of all album equivalent sales in the UK last year, up from less than a quarter four years ago  with physical albums still accounting for the majority of sales.   streaming  However, the digital revolution has not wiped out traditional music listening altogether, due to a revival in popularity of the oldest formats. Vinyl sales hit 4.3m in 2019, the 12th consecutive year of growth, as the popularity of the record reached levels not seen since the 1980s. Liam Gallaghers Why Me? Why Not was the most successful vinyl album of the year.  John Lewis said the vinyl revival had helped turntables become a popular Christmas gift with a 400% increase in sales between November and December. The retailer, which sells a range of models from brands including Audio Technica, Sony and Ion Max priced from 69 to 179, said it has seen a 25% increase in sales of turntables over the past three years.  Singles   albums  The vinyl revival has also rubbed off on the cassette, which by 2012 had all but disappeared save for use by police for taping interviews. While cassette sales remain tiny at 80,400, they almost doubled year-on-year, enjoying their biggest year of sales since 2004. Cassette sales have grown in each of the last seven years. Robbie Williamss festive season release, The Christmas Present, has become the fastest-selling cassette album since compilation Now 52 in July 2002. It is wonderful to see the continued growth of vinyl and the resurrection of the cassette, said Vanessa Higgins, chief executive of the independent label Regent Street Records. It shows fans still love a physical, tangible music artefact in their hands. While overall CD sales continue to plummet, the desire for a collectible product continues to fuel strong sales of premium-quality special editions and box sets. Last year, Queens Platinum Collection sold well over 100,000 copies on CD, a timely release which received a sales boost thanks to the Academy Award-winning biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. Deluxe anniversary releases of Fleetwood Mac and the Beatles collections also sold well. British music proved once again in 2019 that it has a bright future, said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and annual Brit awards. Strong demand for streaming music and vinyl boosted music consumption to levels not seen for 13 years.","647"
"2020-01-01T07:00:58Z","cities","Cities","Wily coyotes take up residence at Trump's New York City golf course","Donald Trump has a $269m golf course in New York City that is regularly prowled by feared, largely nocturnal individuals that instinctively prey upon those they deem smaller and weaker. We are, of course, talking about coyotes. The shrewd canines have spread so far from their ranges in the western US that they are now making unlikely homes in cities on the east coast, including beside the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, a landscaped sward frequented by visor- and chino-wearing golfers in the faintly incongruous setting of the Bronx.   Donald Trump Jr may be an avid hunter but killing coyotes isnt permitted in New York   The staff at the golf course think the coyotes are cool, said Chris Nagy, a wildlife biologist and co-founder of Gotham Coyote, a collaboration of researchers who study coyotes in New York. But theres a point where if the coyotes are getting annoying and worrying the golfers, then theyll change their minds. As humanity chews through landscapes for housing, farming, roads and mining, ecologists have warned of the Earths sixth great extinction, with about a million species now endangered. But some creatures have proved flexible in the face of this onslaught, even blossoming in the new circumstances. Coyotes, unfussy eaters that can cover large distances in search of a suitable home, are one of the winners in this denuded age. Cities like New York and Detroit, where redevelopment or economic blight has left urban sites bereft of humans, are increasingly being colonized by coyotes, as well as other opportunists such as raccoons, opossums and even bobcats. Researchers have found a riot of non-human carnivores dwelling in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina, and Washington DC. New Yorks coyote families Ferry Point Park is a pleasant respite from the city, dotted with redbud trees and affording a grand vista of the Manhattan skyline across the East River. But it is hemmed in by the dense housing of the Bronx and cleaved in two by the Whitestone Bridge, which funnels thousands of cars through every day. It is perhaps surprising that this park, like several in the Bronx, can play host to highly urbanized coyote families. Coyotes, a smaller relative of the grey wolf, weigh up to 50 pounds and are popularly associated with the wide open spaces of the American west. But the animals are highly adaptable and, having thrived rather than dwindled from human expansion and persecution, have pushed east, making it to New York state in the 1940s.    Coyote pups in the Bronx, New York City. Pups were seen scampering on the greens of Trumps golf course at Ferry Point before they learned to steer clear. Photograph: Gotham Coyote   In 2012, Nagy and his colleagues got confirmation via camera traps that coyotes had established themselves in New York City itself, although this shift probably happened earlier. Since then, coyotes have turned up in lower Manhattan and on the roof of a bar in Queens. Last year, one intrepid animal was seen roaming the streets of Harlem before being cornered by police in midtown Manhattan and tranquilized.   Related: High-cat diet: urban coyotes feast on pets, study finds   Were finding coyotes like almost everything or at least can survive on almost everything, Nagy said as he trudged through the scrub and reeds in search of the Ferry Point camera trap. A pack of wolves would need, like, the whole county. But not coyotes. Theyve lived kind of underfoot of both wolves and people for thousands of years. And so theyve evolved to survive metaphorically running among the feet of the giants. Theyre my favorite animal. And I liked them before I started studying them. Theyre clever. Weve tried our best to eradicate them and theyve thwarted us at every turn. I really admire that, I guess. The park, and the adjacent Trump golf course, has become the favoured locale for a coyote named Neil by researchers. Nagys camera traps showed that Neil and a female companion had pups last year, only for the female to then die. The pups, probably lacking proper supervision, were seen scampering on the greens once they were safely clear of golfers. They were wandering all over the place in the morning, Nagy said. And so when the first round of golf would start, the pups were running around the course. We heard stories that the pups were taking sandwiches out of peoples golf carts. Coyotes dont do well in urban areas unless they learn to be circumspect around people, so the pups soon limited their roaming to earlier hours of the night. Donald Trump Jr may be an avid hunter but killing coyotes isnt permitted in New York, even if you are attempting to sculpt a placid vision of nature on a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course that your family business built on a former landfill. Nagy finds the camera trap, strapped to the base of a tree, and removes its casing. Before he replaces the batteries he flicks through the viewfinder to see what it has captured in the previous two months. There is a startled-looking rabbit and an obese raccoon before Nagy lets out an oh.    A coyote in the Bronx. The coyotes wariness of humans has made Manhattans Central Park a step too far for them so far. Photograph: Gotham Coyote   Along with Neil there appears to be a newcomer  what could well be a female mate. So maybe he found a girlfriend, Nagy said. This female, remarkably, has seemingly penetrated miles of dense urban sprawl to stumble across Neil and potentially start a new family. There appears no obvious end to the onward march of coyotes in New York, although the busier tourist drawcard of Central Park in Manhattan might prove tricky due to the animals wariness of humans. Coyotes will almost always run away from human activity, although they will stare down dogs if they approach dens and there is a very small chance of an attack on people if they are seen as a source of food. Respect We encourage all New Yorkers and visitors to respect coyotes and give them plenty of space, said a New York City Parks spokeswoman. Healthy coyotes that are not fed or otherwise conditioned to approach humans will do their best to avoid human contact. They can even be beneficial to humans by helping to control the rodent population. Most people who live in cities dont see or even think of coyotes but the ongoing expansion of urban wildlife provides an opportunity for a more harmonious relationship to nature, evolved from the days when bison were nearly wiped out or when bears were routinely slaughtered. In a broader sense there needs to be a reckoning of how we relate to the rest of the living world, Nagy said. Our theory with coyotes was: kill them all, theyre no good. And theyve not allowed us to do that. So now we have to think, I hope, a little bit more logistically about it.","1080"

In a warning that a decade of decline would undermine the life chances of millions and pave the way for weaker economic growth in future, the Learning and Work Institute said the number of adults taking part in learning had dropped by about 10 percentage points since 2010, equivalent to 3.8 million fewer adults. The research organisation found that just one-third of adults had participated in learning during the previous three years, according to a survey of 5,000 adults across the country, marking the lowest participation rate since it began conducting annual assessments in 1996. The findings follow steep government cuts in education since the imposition of austerity by the Conservative-led coalition government a decade ago. Public spending on adult education excluding apprenticeships has been cut by almost half, while the amount spent by companies on training workers remains low compared with other advanced economies. Boris Johnson promised a 3bn national skills fund to help adults across the country access lifelong learning and training opportunities, in a policy designed to level up the British economy and improve workers personal wellbeing. The Learning and Work Institute said boosting the number of adults in training was vital for driving up productivity in the UK, a key measure of economic efficiency considered crucial by economists for raising workers pay and living standards.  Productivity growth in Britain has stalled in the past decade, rising by just 0.3% on average per year since the 2008 financial crisis, compared with an average of 2% a year in the decade before the crash. Finding widening gaps in participation across the country, the survey showed that about 40% of adults in south-east England had access to education in the last three years, compared with just 24% in the north-east. Adults from lower-income households are half as likely to take part in learning than those in higher-income groups, while those who left school at 16 are half as likely to enter adult learning than those who stayed in education until at least 21.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Stephen Evans, the chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute, warned that upheaval facing the economy as Britain leaves the EU meant access to lifelong education was more important than ever before. If we are to succeed post-Brexit, and if we are to boost productivity and ensure everyone can achieve their potential, we must reverse this decade of decline in adult learning, he added. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said the government was investing to level up skills across the country, adding: Our investment in adult education has supported over a million people in 2018-19 to progress into work, further study, or an apprenticeship.","482"
"2020-01-01T07:00:58Z","environment","Environment","Shipping fuel regulation to cut sulphur levels comes into force","Sulphur will be cut drastically from global shipping transport fuels in 2020, in a move that should reduce some forms of air pollution, and may help towards tackling the climate emergency  but which could also lead to a rise in the price of flights. From 1 January 2020, ships will only be allowed to use fuel oil with a very low sulphur content, under rules brought in by the International Maritime Organisation. This cut in sulphur content has been more than a decade in the planning, and almost all shipping around the world is expected to comply, or face penalties. Member states, the shipping industry and fuel oil suppliers have been working for the past three years to prepare for this major change  I am confident that the benefits will soon be felt and that implementation will be smooth, said Kitack Lim, the secretary general of the IMO. This [is a] hugely important change which will have significant positive benefits for human health and the environment. The new regulations are aimed at cleaning up sulphur emissions, which can cause acid rain and other forms of air pollution, rather than tackling the climate emergency. However, the dirty forms of fuel that contain high levels of sulphur are usually higher carbon too, and the costs of cleaning up sulphur may spur shipping companies to become more efficient in their fuel use, which would cut greenhouse gas emissions directly. Moving to cleaner fuels could add substantially to costs, from an estimated $400 (303) a tonne for fuel oil today to as much as $600 a tonne, according to the International Chamber of Shipping. Higher shipping costs may be absorbed throughout the manufacturing and transport supply chains. The cost impact may also spread beyond shipping, according to the energy analyst firm Wood Mackenzie. Knock-on effects from the cap on sulphur emissions in marine bunker fuel could even wind up giving you a more expensive plane ticket in 2020, the company said. The IMO estimates that the new limit  of 0.5% sulphur content compared with the previous limit of 3.5%, enforced under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships  will cut sulphur oxide emissions from ships by 77%, an annual reduction of about 8.5m tonnes. Fuel oil for shipping has long been one of the dirtiest forms of fossil fuel, made up of the sort of low-value and cheap crude oil that is unsuitable or expensive to refine into high-grade products such as petrol for cars, or kerosene for planes. Ship engines have been designed to cope with such low-grade fuel, and the emissions they belch out as a result mostly happen far from land, making the accompanying pollution less visible and, for many decades, largely ignored by governments. But the damaging effects of the pollution have grown as globalisation has led to a massive increase in shipping transport. Shipping consumed about 3.8m tonnes of fuel oil a day in 2017, according to Wood Mackenzie, equivalent to half of global fuel oil demand. Carbon from shipping makes up about 3% of global total carbon emissions, but is expected to rise to 17% by mid-century. Fuel oil with a high sulphur content produces sulphur oxides, which can cause acid rain and particulate pollution. Alternatives to low-grade, high-sulphur fuel oil are increasingly available, albeit at a higher price. Liquefied natural gas is still a fossil fuel, but much cleaner, and infrastructure allowing its use is becoming more widespread. Biofuels are also being explored as an alternative  one enterprising cruise company is using fish guts for its fuel  and there are high hopes for harnessing hydrogen fuels in the form of ammonia for ship engines. Vessels can also be fitted with scrubbers to remove sulphur, though some of this is then released into the sea as effluent. Ports have also become increasingly concerned at the pollutants from cargo and passenger ships, and some operate zones where sulphur content is even more drastically reduced. Shipping is subject to complex international regulation, overseen by the IMO, the London-based UN body. However, for historic reasons, it has been excluded from calculations of international greenhouse gas emissions, and thus exempted from governments obligations under UN climate agreements, including the landmark Paris accord of 2015. That has meant shipping companies have felt less pressure to cut carbon, and progress on all forms of shipping pollution has been slow and often tortuous. The new sulphur regulations were first enacted by the IMO in 2008, after years of debate, but had to be re-confirmed in 2016 before finally coming into force on Wednesday. Climate change campaigners want to see much faster adoption of regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping. The next major public meeting will be an IMO conference in London in late March and early April, where countries will come under pressure to lay out a clear plan on cutting carbon from the sector, ahead of a major UN climate conference in Glasgow in November. The IMO has a longterm aim to halve carbon from shipping by 2050, but few concrete plans to achieve it. An increasing number of countries, including the UK, are aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050, in line with scientific warnings on the urgency of the climate emergency. The ICS has also proposed a $2 a tonne levy on shipping fuels that would pay into a fund for research and development on zero-carbon forms of shipping, which will be explained to member states at the spring IMO conference, but could take years to come into force.","924"

I belong to a clan where even 100 people, gathered together, cant raise $100 (75) to organise a funeral. I come from a family that couldnt afford to pay tuition of $10 a term when I was a student two decades ago. Many of my young relatives are out of school now, because their parents cant afford a full academic term of $15.  Others are even worse off. There are families I have spoken with who say they are unable to earn $2 a month as a family. There is no question that the UN global goals have stalled. And thats bad news for people like me. I happen to be one of those people who are fixated on the end of extreme poverty, and  if things were to go to plan  the prospect of seeing the global goals come true by 2030. It is common for many small farmers in my region to own land that only measures 30ft by 100ft (or 0.07 acres). My own mum, who lives in a secluded village, only has half an acre. Peoples incomes are defined not by real estate or industrial projects on their land, but by the crops they grow. I cant imagine what will happen when the young generation grows up and divides that land into even smaller fragments, with many of them probably having attained no education and with no jobs available. It is why I feel strongly about how the global goals could change the course of life for people like us. When the millennium development goals were adopted, I was a young school dropout, and didnt know what was happening in the world. My only friends at the time were the boda boda (motorcycle taxis) riders for whom I repaired flat tyres, in a dilapidated garage, in one of the slums of Ugandas capital. The $0.10 that I earned for each flat tyre I repaired offered a liberation from the kind of poverty I had weathered since childhood. But an even bigger, unexpected opportunity appeared: I trained and became a teacher in 2003, thanks to my governments introduction of free teacher training. By the time the global goals were adopted in 2015, a lot had happened in my life. I had taught maths and science in the classroom for seven years, until I quit to become a farmer in 2011. Although teaching itself didnt lift me out of poverty  I struggled to get enough to eat throughout my teaching career  it prepared me to be an informed farmer. Today, I am the only rural poor farmer in my region, and certainly the only one in my clan, who is engaged with the global goals. So, with the ever-spiralling grip of poverty, I keep thinking that maybe something will come out of the goals, to change us for the better.   Related: 'Millions missing out': aid fails to make the grade on early years education   I also feel the urge to do something for myself. I at least trained as a teacher, though this, too, left me poor. In contrast, many in my clan never went to school. So, if I cant do anything to bring lasting change, things will only get worse once I am gone. But, in all this, what breaks my heart is that the current stalling on progress of the global goals means we might end up in the same place in 2030, with nothing new, unless something changes now. I am calling on the global community to get the goals back on track. Its true that times have changed. But there is a lot we can do, especially if the rest of the world directly supports the extreme poor, to help them create lasting, sustainable change. In my region, for instance, the inability of rural farmers to access markets for their produce is the reason they are poor. Farmers need infrastructure to create jobs, and support to get connected to agri companies so they can sell their produce. That way they can tread their own path from poverty.

If you dont manage it by about midday, suddenly its dusk and too late. Living in Cornwall makes you a sitting target for visitors, and we normally have an assortment of friends and family packed into our house. Theres a favourite cove a few miles away, behind Nare Head. Its hard to see from the track above, and the squelchy route down and the cliff-scramble mean that, even in summer, theres rarely anyone else there. The bay is a great gatherer of driftwood (as well as less-flammable flotsam  random shoes, gloves, bath toys, broken fish boxes and cobles). We build a fire and drink hot soup and cook sausages. If theres a swell running, and the tides are low, some of us will tug on wetsuits and boots and try the surf  others might dash in for a new years baptismal dip. To one side of the beach, the cliff has been cut into, forming gullies  or zawns, from the Cornish. You can swim into these and feel the sea surge in and rise and fall against the rocks while you bob, cork-like, upon them, contemplating the ups and downs of the coming year. Philip Marsdens most recent book is The Summer Isles: A Voyage of the Imagination A walk in the woods, Dartmoor Miriam Darlington, writer    Wistmans Wood Photograph: Alamy   The flanks of Dartmoor are always whitened with frost and hidden icicles on new years morning. This is where I set out to, with snow boots, flasks of hot tea and my loved ones.   There's something safe about a wood in winter: we drink steaming tea and watch shadows move around us   Often, we make our way up to Wistmans Wood. This grizzled place is one of the few original ancient oak woods left on the moor, and it feels enchanted. From a distance, its furze of stunted oaks set among the clutter of granite boulders looks unremarkable, but inside is a muscular wood-world of moss boulders and ankle-turning tangles of trunks, roots and loopy beards of lichen. Here, we sit in the stillness between weather patterns and think about our resolutions  what the old year has been and what we wish for the new. Among the trees, we listen to the high, glassy crepitation of twigs conversing from their coatings of ice, poised for the next incoming skitter of cold. There is something safe about a wood in winter: its spacious leaflessness allows you to see your way out, and in the dimpsey light we drink steaming tea and watch shadows move around us. Wistmans Wood is a sheltering place  very slightly uncanny, and good for invoking wishes  but not one in which to linger too long.

Melissa Harrison. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer   Often I was out dancing and doing shots and chatting nonsense with friends and strangers: in a dark, windowless club, perhaps, or at a raucous house party with all the blinds drawn. Sometimes I spent it spark out under a duvet, recovering from the night before. Either way, the day just didnt exist for me: events like the Oxford Street sales, or Londons New Years Day Parade, were purely mythical. I never even saw the sun. Another decade on and things are different. Since moving to Suffolk, Ive made a point of going for a proper walk on 1 January so I can think, and feel, and breathe, and see the new year in. More than once on my rambles Ive come across people botanising, which may seem unlikely given the time of year. But it turns out the New Year Plant Hunt, now nine years old, is fast becoming A Thing: volunteers across the country head out and record whatevers flowering at nyph.bsbi.org, the results analysed by the Botanical Society of Britain & Ireland to shed light on our changing weather. It seems to me a powerful ritual, as well as providing useful data: like the clubs Ive left behind, its a quest for life and promise and colour at the chill, drab turning of the year.

But you will be surprised: hundreds of Lycra-clad triathletes will be thundering through the park, cycling and running. Yes it is likely to be cold, wet and windy, possibly even snowy, but for 25 years the park has hosted a sprint-distance triathlon  there have been Olympic- and world-level athletes out on course alongside many hundreds of first-time triathletes. Each year, around half the field are first-timers, and in the past few years the number of women competing has overtaken the men. The swim is over 400 metres indoors at the Royal Commonwealth Pool (breaking ice on the local lochs is just a step too far). Then the hardy souls take to their bikes for a three-lap, 10-mile route around Arthurs Seat, with a substantial hill to be climbed on each lap. Lastly, its one more run around the park, before heading for the finish line to be rewarded with a medal and to bask in the glory of becoming a New Years Day triathlete. edinburghtri.org Birding, Bristol Tim Dee, nature writer    Avon Gorge.

Some occasions have given me 60 or more species and have been scintillating  the bright sparks of jack snipe flushed at Whiteford Burrows in South Wales; a great grey shrike like an altar candle on the Isle of Sheppey; the grey powder-puff drift of six male hen harriers coming to roost at Wicken Fen. But many first days are cold and dreary, as haggard and hungover as I often am, and my list then has stalled at a few blue and great tits coming to some stale Christmas pudding on my bird table in Bristol. It pays not to set too much store  no augury  by the numbers you achieve by dusk the year can still be won. Nowadays, I twitch less, and go to the Clifton Downs instead for any signs of spring that are already abroad. Snowdrops help to hurry up the year, there are aconites often in these days of milder winters, and if you can hear a mistle thrush belting out its steely-cold spring song from the chilled top of a bare tree on the cliffs of the Avon Gorge, the good life feels within the grasp of all once more.

Egged on by my adventurous cousins, this is where I first got a taste for winter swimming. The first day of the year always involves a swim off Goat Island, in County Waterford, as sausages cook in the sand. Last August I decided to make Dover my home. I moved into a Regency crescent by the castle and from here I can see the waves crash into the harbour below. To beat creeping feelings of isolation I started tentatively dipping myself into the sea; but as autumn has turned to winter these outings have become a necessary daily fix, where no day feels complete without a half-hour swim in the Channel. I now structure my work hours around tide timetables and, come rain or shine, I clip on my fluorescent tow float, pull on my neoprene gloves, and roll into the waves.

Flights of fancy, West Country Kate Rew, founder of The Outdoor Swimming Society    Kate Rew. Photograph: Tim Kavanagh/The Guardian   I like a good time but New Years Eve has always been too much pressure for my wayward ways. I prefer New Years Day. I like starting the year relatively fresh, and ending the day in a clean bed, beaten and battered by exertion and weather. At some point I generate inconceivably long lists that boil down to get fit, drink less, write something and do yoga. Maximum time outside is different every year. Three years ago my husband and I double-dipped, first in fancy dress at the Lyme Lunge in Lyme Regis, Dorset, then under a supermoon. Two years ago we walked up and down Sugarloaf mountain in Monmouthshire. Last year we cycled what felt like the whole of Somerset. A swimmer I know puts her resolutions in a frame in the downstairs loo, so she (and everyone else) can see them. This year Im doing the same, which is already making me reframe them in other ways. The same four core points will undoubtedly be the same, but Im 50 now and this year  this year!  those dreams are coming true.

I love the quiet, the sense that the world has temporarily fallen still. Ive developed a tradition of using it to plan next years planting in my garden. First I walk at Wandlebury Park in the Gog Magog Hills in Cambridge, through the neglected orchards of a former stately home, and then I settle down with tea and the last of the sausage rolls, and sort through seed catalogues, sketching out border designs in my battered garden diary. My favourite is the austere Chiltern Seeds, which has no pictures, only wonderfully vivid and knowledgeable mini-essays. I love old-fashioned cottage garden plants: opium poppies, sweet peas like Black Knight and King Edward VII, candy-striped cosmos and tagetes. But like the Talented Mr Ripley, my true passion is for dahlias, especially the ones that look like sea anemones.

We also try to get outdoors, and for the past two winters weve been in the Scottish Borders, living close to Liddel Water  the river that further downstream forms the boundary between Scotland and England.

Thirteen years ago, Crazy by Gnarls Barkley became the first song to get to No 1 on downloads alone as consumers switched over from CD singles and filled up iPods with individually purchased tracks (and, possibly, pirated ones too), while still purchasing plenty of CD albums. In the years since there have been seismic changes in the industry. As CD players in new cars and home entertainment systems become rarer, while vinyls tactility and size remains more appealing to some, the CD is becoming a marginal format (though they still outsell vinyl by more than five to one). Downloads appear even more anachronistic. Indeed, the very idea of ownership of music  most of all the ownership of intangible mp3 files  is starting to feel quaint to many as more and more of us switch over to streaming. While the data says were not consuming as many albums in 2020 as compared with 2006, this is mostly a wrinkle of how the music industry awkwardly works out what an album sale is in the playlist-dominant streaming age. Rather than buy an album or individual tracks from it, many of us now pay a monthly sum (or endure advertising) to have unlimited access to vast libraries of songs. Were now playing more than 100bn tracks a year, a wild orgy of music consumption.    Lewis Capaldi: most streamed in the UK in 2019.

What is also certain is that with revenues increasing as more of us subscribe to streaming services, artists will clamour louder for that money to be reinvested in the industry  including, amid disquiet at low royalty rates from the likes of Spotify, in the artists themselves.","343"

She made a Facebook post on Tuesday inquiring if there was anything she could do locally to help victims of the devastating bushfires, that have destroyed more than 200 homes and are still burning out of control in East Gippsland and southern NSW. Suddenly she had donations arriving from Melbourne, 280km away. On the heels of the donations came those who had lost everything, but were reluctant to say they needed help. People are proud in Gippsland, McPhan says. We had a couple with three kids here, and he [the father] started crying, she says.

Volunteers are gently ensuring that everyone who accesses the donated goods also registers with emergency services.

"2020-01-01T06:06:58Z","australia-news","Australia news","Australian navy ship prepares to evacuate residents from bushfire-hit Victoria coast","The Australian Defence Force will deploy a massive navy supply ship designed to deal with humanitarian crises to eastern Victoria and the NSW south coast as authorities struggle with the devastating bushfires in both states. Emergency services officials in Victoria said they may use that vessel, the 176-metre-long HMAS Choules, to evacuate residents who have been left stranded at the coastal town of Mallacoota after a large blaze forced 4,000 people to take shelter on the foreshore. It is due to arrive by Friday. Residents and visitors in Mallacoota, an inlet close to the NSW border, awoke to a scene of devastation on Wednesday, and some have reportedly been forced to sleep in their cars or public buildings. They have reported running low on food and water.   Related: Australia is becoming a nation of dread  and the world looks on with pity and scorn | David Marr   At a media conference on Wednesday, Victorias emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said authorities were considering an evacuation by sea and would prioritise those in most need. It doesnt have the current capacity for everyone at Mallacoota, he said. My understanding it has a capacity of 1,000 people. If we were to do that, we would be prioritising those. We are exploring all our options  and certainly to look at evacuating some people from Mallacoota by sea is an option were seriously considering. On Tuesday the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, revealed the state had requested assistance from the military and on Wednesday the defence force outlined its plans. The role of defence has drawn increasing attention as some claim Australia requires a more coordinated, national response to the fires.  Ive spoken with @ScottMorrisonMP & authorised #ADF to deploy extra assets to the Victorian fires: 3 helicopters & 1 aircraft will fly to East Sale; HMAS Choules & MV Sycamore will sail to East Gippsland. A Joint Task Force has been stood up with Army personnel & Liason Officers— Linda Reynolds (@lindareynoldswa) December 31, 2019  In a lengthy statement, defence said it had been providing support to bushfire efforts in all states except Tasmania since 8 November. Later on Wednesday it was due to deploy an MRH-90 Taipan and two S-70A Black Hawk helicopters to an RAAF base at East Sale in Victoria. Those helicopters will be used to support firefighting efforts and humanitarian assistance and will later be joined by two CH-47 Chinooks and two Spartan aircraft to help firefighting efforts and to provide humanitarian assistance to isolated communities. Defence said HMAS Choules would be sent to the NSW south coast as well as Victoria, though it had not yet been determined how it would be used north of the border. Crisp said the Black Hawk helicopters would help crews get on top of the fires that have burned through more than 500,000 hectares across East Gippsland. They give us additional capability, he said. Theyre able to fly at night. Although not dropping water on fires at night, that will give us a great intelligence capability overnight. Fire crews remained concerned that a blaze at Corryong in north-east Victoria would merge with other fires on the NSW border. More than 7,000 homes across East Gippsland and 1,800 in the north-east of the state were without power and many were without phone coverage on Wednesday afternoon. It may take days to restore electricity to these communities.

"2020-01-01T06:00:57Z","lifeandstyle","Life and style","The joy audit: how to have more fun in 2020","The last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many peoples vision of hell: a drunken Taylor Swift club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago. I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business  sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge  I wouldnt say it looms large. I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control. But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. Nataly Kogan, the author of Happier Now, says: Happiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves  theyre actually at the core of what helps us live well. Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to better sleep, better weight management, lower stress levels, an improved immune system and even increased life expectancy. Despite the myriad benefits of joy  and the obvious incentive that it feels good  many of us dont prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite; what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority  which may mean you need to let go of other commitments  and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously. As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives  lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean  fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm. Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. I lived with this idea of: Ill be happy when ... as I know so many people do, she says. We have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better. The gains have been established in research into baseline happiness  what in psychological literature is called our hedonic set point. It varies from person to person, but the key point is that our baseline is only half determined by genetics. That means the other 50% is up to us, says Kogan. I think that is incredibly empowering. So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year? Identify the problem    Draw a large circle, divide it into segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess. Illustration: Adam Higton/The Guardian   Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the wheel of life, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, divide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess. There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction. The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, its not necessarily the one youve marked the lowest; its the one you really value the most, says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesnt matter if it remains only two-thirds filled. The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This negativity bias distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. People can focus on things that are not as they should be  We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise. But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds. The big picture Kogans first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. Be specific, think broadly and dont judge your list as you write it. It doesnt matter what they are, or how many there are; the idea is to shift your mindset. Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. Its not about pretending that nothing is wrong, its about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral. Just three weeks of this consistent gratitude practice has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says Shamash Alidina, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness  and more attainable than people may think. Many equate mindfulness with clearing ones mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina  but its not about not thinking, its about being aware. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your flexibility of attention, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. People associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but its really just about not getting lost in your thoughts, he says. What does it all mean? Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose  to find what she calls the bigger why among our deadlines and meetings. Its not possible to be a happy human being if you dont feel like what youre doing is meaningful, she says. Assessing your to-do list  particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating  through the lens of Who does this help? can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. When you say: This project is going to help a lot of people  my team, customers, readers, whatever  your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it. Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships  one of the most common factors in job satisfaction.   Play is an effective moodbooster that is often neglected in adulthood   The mindset shift encouraged by practising intentional kindness means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to be kind. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasnt spoken to in a while and telling them that shes thinking of them: I cannot tell you how much that means to people. Family fortunes It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like  and how to forge them  can be ambiguous. Happiness can feel very abstract, says Gretchen Rubin, the author of The Happiness Project. My approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take. In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubins family email each other an update on the boring everyday stuff of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. We realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected  and its absolutely working. Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (I always think that I dont want to be less enthusiastic than my dog, says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up  and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. My way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year  are there things you can do to be happier? she says. And if there are, why not do them? Home truths If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, outer order contributes to inner calm, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. It feels trivial  and yet over and over people say: When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally, says Rubin. Like making your bed every morning  it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense. Often this is understood as minimalism  but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests can be very pleasing. Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of The Aesthetics of Joy, agrees. Weve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: whats trendy, what the design books say, she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own joy meters. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door.    Control is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Illustration: Adam Higton/The Guardian   Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: Not only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because youre less worried about bumping into sharp edges. Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and St Patricks Day with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happinesss pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults. To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: Notice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained? The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. Owning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things, says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog Becoming Minimalist. Being intentional with the things that we own  and, by extension, our money  means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. Minimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life, says Becker. Early to bed Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. Sometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something, says Rubin. A happy life is not one thats focused only on the present. Embracing boredom In the same vein, putting off a difficult or boring task can detract from your daily experience more than getting stuck into it. Waite says she rolls her eyes at the framing of self-care as baths and candles: I love those things, but if doing your tax return is really making you anxious, maybe the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a start. It may not be what is typically understood by joy, but sustainable, long-lasting happiness involves recognising that there are many shades on the emotional palette. Research shows that occasionally accepting the presence of harder emotions means you experience them less intensely and for less time. In fact, the first step towards a joyful life may be letting go of your ideas of what that looks like  and recognising that it is down to you. Part of this exercise is to recognise that there isnt anything out there that is going to make you feel good 100% of the time, says Kogan. Thats actually great news, because when we let go of this particular idea of happiness we give ourselves more opportunities to be in alignment with our lives. ","2340"

But 12 months on, what has changed? Has there been any tangible improvement? Well, yes and no. After all, this was the year when a 1 bikini went on sale in the name of womens empowerment, a staggering piece of double-speak from its maker, the aptly named Missguided, which was criticised over the potential environmental and social costs of such a product.    Missguideds 1 bikini. Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian   While some brands continue to pump out clothes like there is no tomorrow (which if they carry on, there wont be), many of us are rethinking the quantities of clothes we buy. Greta Thunberg was i-Ds most memorable cover star, the girl who changed the world, who turned up for the interview dressed in a purple puffer jacket, bright-pink snow trousers and rubber boots. Her wardrobe is limited, she doesnt want new things, the magazine reported. In July, the Swedish Fashion Council cancelled Stockholm fashion week to explore more sustainable options, and Extinction Rebellion called for London Fashion Week to do the same. London fashion week went ahead as planned but the final day was marked by a symbolic funeral where XR Fashion members grieved for the industry. Never has the fashion and textile industry been such a focus of attention, primarily because of its disproportionate contribution to greenhouse gas emissions  1.2bn tonnes of CO2 per year according to Greenpeace, more than that produced by international shipping. In August, 32 companies representing around 150 brands signed the Fashion Pact at the G7 summit, promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 and to ban virgin plastic from packaging  by 2030. Considering that, according to the UN, we only have 10 years left to limit global warming to 1.5C, these are hollow targets. Its not only the environment that the industry continues to disregard. The fire in December at the New Delhi bag factory, where around 100 people were sleeping overnight, resulted in more than 40 deaths. Six years on from the Rana Plaza factory collapse, most brands still have far too little visibility of their supply chains, said Carry Somers, co-founder of the organisation behind the #whomademyclothes campaign, Fashion Revolution. Transparency leads to accountability which leads to change. The Fashion Transparency Index is also pushing the industry towards greater transparency with year on year improvement for many of the brands listed. In a welcome move towards transparency, H&M announced back in April that it would share details such as production country, supplier names, and names and address of factories with its customers.     Extinction Rebellion protest during London fashion week, 17 September 2019. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters   It has been a year of big statements by famous names, perhaps the boldest being Guccis claim in September that it was now carbon neutral. The greenwash radar went into overdrive. The best way to get to zero emissions is to close the company, but then 18,000 people will lose their jobs. When we talk about the environment, we need to keep that in mind as well, said CEO Marco Bizzarri. Offsetting is better than not doing anything While some industry leaders are at least starting to send out positive messages, policy makers are not so enthusiastic. In June, the government rejected recommendations made by the environmental audit select committee to regulate the fast fashion industry, including a charge of 1p for each garment to fund better clothing collection and sorting, and a ban on incinerating unsold clothes or sending them to landfill. The government is out of step with the public, who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill, said the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chaired the committee. Despite the governments inability to legislate, fashion activism was on the rise. In September, 62,000 people took part in Oxfams Secondhand September campaign, pledging to buy nothing new in an attempt to stem the flow of the 11m items of clothing sent to landfill every week in the UK. And an alternative to Black Friday is gaining momentum in the form of Buy Nothing Day. In a world of overconsumption and fast fashion, one of the most radical things we can do is to keep our clothes in use for as long as possible, declared the designer Christopher Raeburn, who closed the tills at his two stores and spent the day doing on-the-spot clothing repairs instead.    Resale platform  Vestiaire Collective at Selfridges. Photograph: Tom D Morgan   The willingness to embrace new ways of shopping that disrupt the high-volume, fast-fashion model, such as resale platforms (Vestiaire Collective and Depop both popped up at Selfridges this year and continue to grow their audiences) and rental (witness the takeover of the (British) Fashion Awards in December by rental platform My Wardrobe HQ)  is tangible. Bethany Williams scooped the prize for best emerging talent for menswear at awards, having already won the Queen Elizabeth II award for design earlier in the year. She was also shortlisted for the LVMH prize and is nominated for the upcoming Arts Foundation award (winner announced in January).

"2020-01-01T06:00:56Z","tv-and-radio","Television & radio","Messiah review – it's Homeland ... with a divine twist","Is he the messiah? Or is he a very naughty boy? These are the animating questions of the 10-part Netflix drama Messiah, a political thriller built around the advent in Syria of a young preacher man (played with grace, charm and passion by Mehdi Dehbi). He catches peoples attention by fearlessly urging them to set aside old divisions and listen to his message of peace, love and unity, which seems to incorporate the best of most of the main religions. This is very generous of him, considering he also possesses a set of cheekbones upon which he could hang a new and very self-centred one. For what I suspect are a variety of spiritual, aesthetic and carnal reasons, his following soon grows in numbers. However, the CIA (particularly the agent Eva Geller  played by Michelle Monaghan  who is recently widowed and nursing a secret, possibly fatal, illness, because non-prophets are also interesting) is sceptical. Alongside assorted other cynical parties, the intelligence agency is not convinced that he is our saviour newly born to Earth. It runs him through its databases and finds no trace of him, but reckons he can only be either a con artist or a terrorist who has found a new way to bring about a war. The latter view looks increasingly probable as our lord of the cheekbones leads a group of Muslim refugees out of Damascus, after (as they come to see it) conjuring a sandstorm that spikes the guns of Isis just as they are about to take the city, and up to the border of Israel. He is arrested by the police and interrogated by Aviram (Tomer Sisley), a soldier in the Israeli army. The prophet seems to have unwarranted knowledge of his personal history. As a result, Aviram deletes the tape of their interview. This comes back to bite him when the high priest of the zygomatic arch pulls off his second apparent miracle and escapes from a locked cell overnight. After only a brief pause at Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem  to preach the maxillofacial word and heal a boy shot in front of him by trigger-happy police excited to be closing in on their escapee  the prophet next appears in the US, seemingly having saved a pastors daughter from a tornado (and indirectly preventing the debt-ridden pastor from torching his church for the insurance). The seeds of another following are sown. Unsurprisingly, the CIA is no more keen on the home-soil outpost than it was on the original. As the series goes on, the influence of social media and investigations into the potentially holy ones motivations by old-fashioned proper journalists (represented by Jane Adams, playing a dogged CNN reporter called Miriam Keneally) add further layers of complexity. The whole thing is like Homeland, with a divine twist. However, the twist may already have been spoiled. Muslim Arabic speakers have complained that one of the names the writers have used for Zygoman translates as something that gives away the ending; a hazard, these people say, of the writers borrowing names and iconography from a religion and a culture they dont fully understand. Whether this is the case, or an elaborate multiple bluff is in play, Messiah is potent stuff packed with fine performances. My feeling is that, even if the shows creators had only a basic understanding of the relevant religious and cultural considerations, the mistake being asserted by viewers would be quite difficult to make. I hope that the people behind a multicultural series that deals with Jewish and Muslim conflict had the sense to hire all sorts of experts to protect sensitivities and highlight potential problems  but perhaps I am being overly optimistic.

Britons need to say goodbye to burgers and meat, we wrote, because the overemphasis on meat in the western diet is one of the things that stifles sustainable food production. Thankfully, the past decade and a half has seen an unprecedented interest in meat-free diets. In 2004, veganism was seen as a fussy, faddish lifestyle choice. Now, buoyed by blockbuster documentaries such as Cowspiracy and What the Health, and celebrities such as Ellie Goulding and Ariana Grande, it has never been so popular. According to the Vegan Society, 600,000 Britons are vegan. In 2006, this figure was just 150,000. Demand for vegan food is at unprecedented levels: in 2018, the UK launched more vegan products than any other nation; in 2019, 250,000 people signed up for the Veganuary challenge, pledging to avoid all meat and dairy for the month of January. For those not willing to make the jump to full veganism, one in three Britons had at least reduced their meat consumption in 2018. But there is still a long way to go. The wests overconsumption of meat and dairy continues to fuel global warming. Livestock is responsible for approximately 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions; 70% of global deforestation takes place in order to grow animal feed. In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet and Health determined that substantial dietary shifts must take place by 2050. Global consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes will have to double, and consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar will have to be reduced by more than 50%, the panel of experts judged. By 2050, meat-eating could seem like a throwback, according to some experts. Our current method of growing crops to feed to animals so we can eat animals is shockingly inefficient, says Bruce Friedrich of the Good Food Institute, which works to develop alternatives to meat. By 2050, [almost] all meat will be plant-based, or cultivated.    There wont be factory farms or abattoirs in 2050: beef cattle in Argentina, a major cow-meat producer. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images   Plant-based meat is already here. The Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger are widely available, but Friedrich predicts a widening of the products on offer to consumers. Well have plant-based meat that doesnt exist yet, whether its pork chops, steaks, tuna or salmon. Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation, thinks that plant-based substitutes will find their way into processed foods, without consumers being any the wiser. Plant-based alternatives to animal protein will appear automatically in foods we eat, without consumers having to change their habits. The real challenge will be persuading consumers to embrace cultivated meat. Also known as lab-grown meat, this is developed from animal or fish cells in the nutrient bath of a bioreactor. It is not yet on the market, but at least 40 private companies are working on cultivated-meat alternatives. In the UK, scientists at the University of Bath are growing bacon on blades of grass. The California startup JUST has created chicken nuggets in a bioreactor. Friedrich is optimistic that we will all be eating cultivated meat by 2050. There wont be factory farms or abattoirs in 2050, he predicts. People will look back at the idea of growing live animals for meat in the same way that we look back at horse-drawn carriages for getting from London to Brussels. But we wont entirely stop eating meat from animals reared for slaughter. There will be some heritage breed farms and slaughterhouses where the animals are treated well, Friedrich concedes. But it will be a limited market.   Growing live animals for meat will seem as archaic as taking a horse-drawn carriage from London to Brussels   If this all sounds like science fiction, strap yourselves in for the predictions of the food designer and futurist Chlo Rutzerveld. Well skip all of our current existing foods and switch towards a whole new eating system where we build food with microorganisms, she says. Instead of growing crops or raising animals, well use microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, yeast and microalgae to directly produce the carbs, proteins and fats we need. This food will again be produced in bioreactors, before being filtered and dried into powders. But we wont be consigned to a joyless diet of flavourless dust. Rutzerveld claims that 3D-printing technology will be able to replicate the textures and flavours of regular food. We can make a library of mouth feels and texture at a nanoscale, she says, in order to recreate sensations like freshness or juiciness. Eating microorganisms grown in bioreactors will be transformative. Well be able to make the food-production system so much more efficient, saving the land and water and energy resources.    A burger made with a scrambled-egg imitation made from mung beans by the plant-based food startup JUST. Photograph: Just Inc/Reuters   Not everyone agrees. Lab-grown meats are a red herring, says Prof Pete Smith of the University of Aberdeen. We dont need them. We can get most of the protein we need from plant-based foods. He is also doubtful that we will move to other protein sources such as insects. Wealthy countries are already massively overconsuming protein, he says. We dont need to move to alternate protein sources  if we cut in half the amount of protein we are already eating, we would be at healthier levels. But even if we are not eating insects directly, they can still be of use in our wider food chain. Insects could be really important for feeding animals, says Taylor. One of the problems we have is that ruminant animals (including cattle, sheep and goats) are often fed on soya, which is grown in deforested parts of the planet. If we could shift to other ways of feeding animals, such as insects, we can reduce deforestation. Consumers will continue to turn to plant-based alternatives to dairy. Plant-based milks are already big business, and egg substitutes will be next: JUST and Zero Egg have already developed egg substitutes, and we can expect other brands to emerge. By 2050, climate change will dramatically affect what we can eat and drink. Speciality crops such as avocados, coffee and wine grapes  which can only be grown in a very narrow climate range  will be at risk. A one- or two-degree change in climate could mean make-or-break for some regions growing speciality crops, says Prof Gregory V Jones, an expert in wine growing at Linfield Colleges department of environmental studies. Wine-growing regions such as Greece, southern Italy, southern Spain and Portugal will all potentially experience issues, he continues. In turn, though, wine-growing will become possible in places such as Scandinavia and the north of England. They arent world-class producing regions now, but by 2050, if climate change continues, they could be.    Bananas will no longer be a cheap household staple. Photograph: Alamy   If real progress isnt made to halt global heating, food production in the global south will be imperilled. Things arent looking good for the developing world, says Smith. China has a big problem with water  overextraction means that the soil is becoming too salty. India also has a problem with unsustainable groundwater use. Rice-growing in China and wheat-growing in the northern plains of India could be affected. All of this augurs badly, given that China and Indias population is forecast to rise to a combined 3.2 billion by 2050. Water stress will become more acute, Smith warns. The more the climate warms, the more droughts we will have. This will take place in areas that are already struggling to feed themselves. In the UK, much imported produce may become prohibitively expensive. We are very reliant on countries that are vulnerable to climate change and water scarcity, says Taylor. The grapes and berries we now import from Morocco, Spain, India and South Africa will become scarce. We will have to return to more seasonal patterns of eating  bananas, for example, will no longer be a cheap household staple. Widening inequality will play out on dinner tables across the world. Im worried about uneven dietary development, says Prof Corinna Hawkes of the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London. The diets of rich people will get better, and those of poorer people will get worse, and well end up with appalling inequalities in what were eating. She predicts that wealthy people will continue to reduce their meat and processed-food intake, and embrace indigenous food such as sorghum and amaranth. These foods were once eaten by poor people, but will become resurgent in higher-income groups, as they become more interested in novel foods. As fast-food companies continue to make inroads into developing nations, junk-food consumption will rise in historically impoverished communities. These people have inadequate diets already, says Hawkes, and they will be adding junk food into their diet, which only contributes to the problem of obesity.   Rich people's diets will get better, and poorer people's will get worse  well have appalling inequalities   Rising obesity rates are a real cause for concern; half of Britains population is predicted to be obese before 2050. Globally, 60% of men and 50% of women will be obese by 2050, if current trends continue. We need to put into place policies that level the playing field and reduce the abilities of the companies selling junk food to make it so affordable and accessible, says Hawkes. Junk food needs to be taken out of the spotlight and nutritious food put centre-stage. So, what should we be eating in 2050? Its fairly simple  what we should be eating now. (And what the Guardian predicted in 2004.) We need to be eating more fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, less junk food, and less meat and dairy, advises Taylor. If we do these four things, we stand a chance of reversing some of the diet-related diseases that are currently crippling the NHS, and also bringing down the carbon and biodiversity impacts of our diet. But whether well be able to resist the siren pull of processed food and cheap meat remains to be seen.

As bushfire spread to the precipice of the cliffs on Tuesday, more than 1,000 people stood on the beach, hemmed in by a ring of fire and the Pacific Ocean. Everyone was on the beach, just covered in ash and smoke, Al Baxter, the former Wallaby, told Guardian Australia.

There were a couple of horses on the beach, dogs, cats, budgies, prize chooks, and a whole menagerie of animals. There was a strange calmness. People were as close to the waters edge as they could [be]. People were literally just lying on the beach trying to keep out of the smoke and ash.

As night fell, a group found a way into a building site near the beach, where the concrete shell of a future apartment complex provided shelter enough for about 100 people who slept there. Others stayed on the beach. Baxter had been holidaying at Rosewood with a group of about 12 people, his wife, three kids and other friends and family members. They stayed on the floor of a holiday apartment near the beach. By morning enough local roads were open to direct people back to Batemans Bay.

Scientists have cited the lack of moisture in the landscape  following years of drought  as a key reason the fires have been so severe. Intense heat, dry conditions and strong winds have created conditions where the fire risk is considered extreme or catastrophic. While increasing greenhouse gas emissions do not directly cause bushfires, evidence shows they play a role in increasing average and extreme temperatures, which in turn contribute to the extraordinarily dry conditions.","705"

Just before the setting sun dips behind Wolsingham Park Moor, the water surface becomes a mirror that bounces glancing sunbeams into the tree canopy. Seen from across the reservoir, trunks and branches are bathed in a golden glow, every twig etched with startling clarity against the gathering dusk within the wood. This afternoon, as I walked among those trees, the lighting was pure theatre. My vision struggled to accommodate its extremes, of dazzling white trunks of silver birch, rough-textured grey bark of ancient oaks, vivid green mosses and deep black shadows.    A nuthatch appeared as a fleeting monochrome silhouette, hanging on the shadowy underside of a branch. Photograph: Phil Gates   A nuthatch appeared as a fleeting monochrome silhouette, hanging on the shadowy underside of a branch, dagger beak wheedling out something from a fissure. It vanished behind the trunk, then reappeared in bright sunlight, in full colour, unmistakable in its bandit-mask black eye-stripe, slate-blue back, and apricot chest feathers. Just another nuthatch. But when I first came to live hereabouts, more than 40 years ago, these were rare birds in County Durham. Reading through my natural history notebooks from the 1970s I see that they merited a specific mention on the few occasions when I saw one. Now they are common. Their relentless northerly advance is often attributed to milder winters, brought about by climate change, though its far from clear exactly what factors have changed in their favour. It would now be noteworthy to walk in deciduous woodlands in Weardale and not see  or, more often, hear  these birds; they have a piercing call, especially in late winter and early spring when courtship begins.    Seen from across the reservoir, trunks and branches are bathed in a golden glow. Photograph: Phil Gates   Personal nature notebooks, often ledgers of profit and loss, can be emotive documents, with the growing awareness of shifting baseline syndrome, where succeeding generations are denied the pleasure of seeing once-commonplace species that disappear during their parents lifetime. In the 1970s I recorded red squirrels here; I would now need to travel much further afield to see one. But in the case of the nuthatch, in this precious fragment of ancient woodland, the syndrome seems to have worked in reverse.","363"

Its contents  pages of musical composition  were placed in the Polish national library for safekeeping, where they lay forgotten for years.
The manuscripts had been buried by Wyszogrodzkas great-grandfather, the composer Ludomir Rycki, before he fled the war-torn city.
On a recent afternoon, Wyszogrodzka wiped tears from her face as she listened to a Polish virtuoso violinist bring the works to life.
Listening to the music, its like getting to know my great-grandfather for the first time, said Wyszogrodzka, an economist, sitting in the foyer of the Philharmonic Hall in Szczecin, north-west Poland after a concert of Ryckis works. To think, these pieces might have been lost forever.

 Related: 'This is the golden age': eastern Europe's extraordinary 30-year revival 

Janusz Wawrowski, considered Polands leading classical violinist, spent about a decade reconstructing Ryckis Violin Concerto  an exuberant, optimistic work comparable to that of George Gershwin or the film composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold, which was never performed in his lifetime  after finding the original orchestral score as well as the basic piano arrangement in two separate archives.
When he realised by what he calls a happy accident that they belonged to one and the same Rycki Violin Concerto, he started the complicated task of musically intertwining them.
I spent years experimenting to get the sound I think Rycki would have wanted, Wawrowski said. I changed it to make it more violinistic, more technically complicated  as he was more of a pianist. To me its full of the energy and life of Warsaw before the war, and I think he was trying to conjure and convey this positive energy as he wrote it in 1944 in a very dark time, as the artillery of the Nazis rained down on the city.
As he performed the Violin Concerto with Szczecins Symphony Orchestra at the weekend to rave reviews, Wawrowskis Stradivarius appeared to want to take flight as the musician, dressed in a turquoise silk shirt, lifted and dipped his toes, mastering the many double stops and chords of a piece with hints of everything from ragtime to polonaise. It was, critics said, reminiscent of Stravinsky or Brahms, with whom Rycki in his heyday was often compared.
Piotr Urbaski,  a musicologist at Poznan University, said it was rich, clear and brilliant, connecting us with a part of Polish history which was very tough (when it was under the occupation of Nazi Germany) but he used his music to encourage optimism, like a kind of therapy. At the same time, he said, he believed Rycki hoped the composition, with its patriotic overtones, would help establish him as a national composer of Poland.
Wawrowski has recorded the concerto with Londons Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, under the baton of its principal associate conductor, Grzegorz Nowak, who is Polish. Both men are hoping that the recording, due out next year, will help bring Rycki to a wider audience and put him firmly back at the heart of the Polish classical canon, where he was in the 1920s and 30s alongside the likes of Mieczysaw Karowicz, Grzegorz Fitelberg and Karol Szymanowski, who were collectively referred to as Young Poland.

He was one of the most important composers of the first half of the 20th century, said Urbaski, but hes unknown to most Poles today. Lets hope that will now change.
Rycki studied piano and composition at the Warsaw Conservatory and continued his musical education in Weimar Berlin under the German opera composer Engelbert Humperdinck, where he befriended the likes of Richard Strauss and Giacomo Puccini. His ballet Pan Twardowski was an international success, performed across central and eastern Europe, including more than 800 times in Warsaw.
Wyszogrodzka said family stories about the composer were rare. Her great-grandmother remarried after his death in 1953 and kept many details to herself. But I do remember my grandmother telling me how he had been interrogated by the Gestapo, she said.
They had tried to make him sign the so-called Volksliste, a Nazi-party initiative to classify the desirability of inhabitants of the regimes occupied territories. Rycki refused and so was forced to flee. There were no USB sticks in those days, so he was forced to put his scores in a suitcase and bury it in the garden, Wyszogrodzka said. The family thought theyd have the opportunity to find it after the war, but they never came back, and assumed it had been lost or destroyed.
At the recent concert, Wawrowski and the orchestra, under the baton of Norbert Twrczyski, also performed Ryckis Pieta, a work he completed in 1942, the manuscript of which was destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising.
He had kept a memory of it in his head, so after the war, settled near Katowice, he was able to construct it, with the help of musician friends, said Wawrowski, who believes there are hundreds of abandoned works waiting to be discovered in Polish archives.
Rycki had also wanted to reconstruct from memory the incomplete Violin Concerto but his violinist friends, whom he might have consulted, were scattered far and wide because of the war. Ive sometimes thought I was a substitute for the violinist friend, having that conversation with him but decades apart, Wawrowski said.","890"

The downpour has been postponed officially until late January. Things are looking up: it was April. Either way the experts are saying the weeks ahead are looking dry, tinder dry. As that news sank in this summer an unfamiliar emotion took hold in Australia: not fear so much as dread. These fires are not going out. We know the language of fires. All our lives weve waited to hear a blaze is under control. Sweet words. But these days they come with a caveat: only for a few days until the wind shifts and the fire jumps the lines.

The North Korean leader told a four-day meeting of party officials in Pyongyang that the test ban, which Kim agreed to in talks with the US president, was no longer needed, state media said on Wednesday. Kim also reportedly said his country planned to introduce a new strategic weapon in the near future.   Related: 2019: the year US foreign policy fell apart   In response, Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and believed the North Korean leader would keep his word to refrain from nuclear and long-range missile tests. He did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearisation. ... That was done in Singapore, and I think hes a man of his word, so were going to find out, Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.  Trumps secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he hoped North Korea would choose peace over war. So, seeing that reporting publicly, it remains the case that we hope that chairman Kim will take a different course, Pompeo told Fox News in an interview. Were hopeful that ... chairman Kim will make the right decision  hell choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war. In an interview with CBS News, Pompeo said Kim should honour commitments he made in meetings with Trump last year. If chairman Kim has reneged on the commitments he made to president Trump, that is deeply disappointing, Pompeo said. He made those commitments to president Trump in exchange for president Trump agreeing not to conduct large-scale military exercises. Weve lived up to our commitments. We continue to hold out hope that he will live up to his as well. North Korea has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland and has carried out six nuclear tests. A self-imposed ban has been at the centre of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has involved three meetings between him and Trump, but little tangible progress. The US had made gangster-like demands in the talks process, Kim said, including continuing joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions. The world will witness a new strategic weapon possessed by [North Korea] in the near future, Kim said. We will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US and guaranteeing our long-term security. Analysts said the declaration amounted to Kim putting a missile to Donald Trumps head but that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire. Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kims promise to him not to carry them out, and played down launches of shorter-range weapons. Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February. The North Korean leaders announcement on Wednesday came after the United States missed a year-end deadline for a restart of denuclearisation talks. Kim convened the rare meeting of the ruling partys policy-making committee on Saturday as the US had not responded to his repeated calls for concessions to reopen negotiations, dismissing the deadline as artificial.    The Workers partys fifth plenary meeting in Pyongyang on Monday (Kim in white on the far end of the stage).

The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future, he added, using the acronym for the countrys official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. The announcement preceded Kims annual new year speech, a key moment in the North Korean political calendar, reviewing the past and setting out goals for the future. It will be Kims eighth such address after he revived the tradition started by his grandfather  North Koreas founding leader, Kim Il-sung  but discontinued during his fathers rule.   Related: The Guardian view on North Korea: a brewing nuclear crisis | Editorial   Kim made clear to party officials that the North was willing to live under international sanctions to preserve its nuclear capability. The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude, KCNA cited him as saying. Washington had conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said, and stepped up sanctions against the North. We can never sell our dignity, he added, saying Pyongyang would shift to a shocking actual action to make [the US] pay for the pains sustained by our people. For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up. North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trumps head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee, said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington. Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken, he added. He is gambling that threatening another demonstration of his ability to hit the US homeland with a nuclear weapon will somehow push America into granting more concessions. But the strategy was unlikely to be effective, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury threats coming from Donald Trumps Twitter account. The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carried out a long-range missile test.An ICBM launch would also be likely to frustrate China, the Norths key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its backyard. But ties between Pyongyang and Beijing have warmed markedly in the past two years, with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, paying his first visit to the North as head of state in June, and Beijing and Washington at loggerheads over trade and other issues. In December China and Russia  another key economic partner for the North  proposed loosening UN sanctions against Pyongyang, and analysts said Kim is likely to seek to exploit rivalries between Washington, Beijing and Moscow.","1045"

Forecasters predict very hot and windy conditions for South Australia on Friday and dangerous bushfire conditions for eastern Victoria and New South Wales on Saturday, with temperatures again reaching into the mid-40s. We are assuming that on Saturday weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. That is something all of us have to brace ourselves for.   Related: Climate patterns behind Australia's bushfires, heat and drought set to improve   Patchy showers and thunderstorms are expected with a cold front through Western Australia on Saturday, moving across into Victoria and South Australia on Sunday, reaching NSW late on Sunday or early Monday. But Jonathan How, a forecaster at the bureau, told Guardian Australia it was uncertain if any significant rain would reach bushfire areas. He said: We could see some widespread showers and thunderstorms through the south-east of the country, but its going to be patchy and its uncertain whether it gets to those fire sites.    Four-day rainfall forecast for Australia, 5-8 January 2020. Photograph: Bureau of Meteorology   How said Wednesday was much cooler across the south-east after a run of hot days, bringing brief relief for Tasmania, Victoria and NSW. From tomorrow, we start to see the heat build again from southern parts of WA and South Australia. Friday is a very hot day across South Australia and Victoria with Adelaide getting up to 42C on Friday. Inland Victoria and South Australia will be getting into the mid-40s. He said South Australia would experience elevated fire dangers on Friday, with forecast high temperatures including 45C for Renmark and 46C for Port Augusta. Mildura in Victoria could reach 44C. Saturday was already shaping up to be a day of high fire risk for eastern Victoria and New South Wales with temperatures in the high 30s and early 40s across areas that are currently burning. That is going to push up fire dangers in Gippsland and southern parts of New South Wales, How said. Canberra may reach 42C on Saturday, with temperatures in the western suburbs of Sydney forecast to rise as high as 45C. The best chance of rainfall over the next week could come on Sunday, with lower temperatures and patchy showers and thunderstorms moving from South Australia and into northern parts of Victoria and southern NSW. In the north and north-west of the country, there could be more significant rain as a monsoon trough moves south over the next two days, that will be good news for those in the Top End, How said. Forecasters were also watching for a possible tropical low developing in waters south of Indonesia towards the end of this week and early next week.","457"

Victorian authorities say about 50 properties have been lost across Buchan, Sarsfield and Mallacoota, but that figure is expected to rise.
More than 100 fires are burning in NSW, but conditions have eased and all fires have been downgraded to watch and act level.
Three fires are burning at emergency level in Victoria as a dozen burn across the east and north-east.
Firefighters in NSW are using the improved conditions to contain existing fires and prepare for Saturday, which is tipped to rival Tuesdays fire danger levels.

Theyre piled somewhere between five and ten inches high, sometimes stacked neatly, sometimes in pleasing disarray. Theres invariably a Booker prize winner or shortlistee in there, along with that novel everyones been raving about since August, and a self-help book masquerading as an important comment on our times. Maybe theres a classic or two, a slender small-press gem, and the next big thing in new release nonfiction. Theres an art to the summer reading stack, of course. Its balanced in genre, represents diversity of authorship, covers off at least two major preoccupations of the zeitgeist while nodding to the greats of literature past. These are all good things. And theres something really comforting about pictures of exciting books by great writers in good company, tinted with soft yellow and accompanied by words of reader enthusiasm.   Related: Christos Tsiolkas, Charlotte Wood and Tara June Winch recommend your next favourite book   But I cant help but wish for a little honesty. Because youre probably not going to read that 700-page literary prizewinner this summer, are you? And when you flop down on your beach towel/poolside deck chair/the couch after a summer bender, are you really going to pick up that terribly important but probably quite difficult political nonfiction? Or are you just going to flick on the TV and watch Henry Cavill grunt woodenly for three hours? Its not that those books dont deserve to be read  the merits of authorship or the contribution to literature made by the worthy writers in these visual reading lists has nothing to do with it. Its just that like most things we post on social media, the summer reading stack is both aspirational and performative: I want to be the kind of person who reads books like this on my summer holiday, it says. But implicit in the act of posting the photo for public consumption is the hope that we become someone who is at least seen as the kind of person who reads those books on their summer holiday  whether or not we do actually read them.   Ive come to think of reading like a muscle: it needs regular exercise ... but it also needs rest   And sometimes reading is hard. Even if you #lovereading, sometimes its an obligation rather than a joy. The irony of the thing you love more than anything turning into the thing that you dread is perhaps the cruellest of them all. For a lot of us, the more that books and writing feature in our work and study, the more likely we are to feel overwhelmed by the need to read as much as possible, and the social pressure to be seen doing so. Personally, when it comes to my summer downtime, the last thing I want to do is read very serious and important things. If Im going to read at all, its going to be impulsive, haphazard, and not very Insta-worthy. My honest summer reading stack would look something like this:  The first two chapters of a weighty tome I keep saying Ill read but will more than likely never finish Three Georgette Heyer romances, back to back (sleep optional) Sundry articles spat up by algorithm on Facebook Half of a trashy thriller found on the sparse bookshelf of a beachside AirBnB The new Ann Patchett, because theres an exception to every rule and she can do no wrong    Related: Move over Amazon: celebrating Australia's diverse independent bookshops this Christmas   I am an advocate of reading widely and well. Im an advocate of reading important books, not just fun ones. Im even an advocate of occasionally filtering day-to-day life through a flattering sepia lens. But Ive come to think of reading like a muscle: it needs regular exercise in order to be capable of running a marathon or getting through that doorstopper  but it also needs rest. Sometimes you just need to do an easy lap of the neighbourhood, maybe stopping to look at the birds for a bit instead of keeping track of your pace, then eat a good meal and zonk out. And sometimes you need to do absolutely nothing whatsoever. And thats OK too.","662"

Met Service forecaster Cameron Coutts said the intensity of the Australian bushfires in the past few days had fuelled the New Zealand haze, and this was the fourth time this summer New Zealand had been affected by fires across the Tasman.  The last couple of days the fires in Australia have picked up in their intensity and produced a significant amount of smoke, Coutts said. Most of it is at high levels once it reaches New Zealand. There is the odd report of people being able to smell smoke, but it is not really affecting us at ground level at the moment, even though it is quite thick. Coutts said the smoke could increase the chance of rain and thunderstorms in the South Island, of which significant levels of both were forecast later on Wednesday. Holidayers in the popular party town of Wanaka were the first to notice the haze, which people variously described as sepia, orange and apocalyptic. Many people in Queenstown and Wanaka also noted a strong smell of smoke and burning.  In New Zealand, just outside Queenstown... can smell the smoke. Hard to tell from the photo but there is an orange haze settling in over everything. pic.twitter.com/H4kjgaZ4yx— Miles P Herbert (@MilesPHerbert) December 31, 2019  A spokesperson for the Queenstown Lakes District Council said no health warnings had been issued, and the council had been assured the haze offered no danger to local residents. As it currently stands visibility is pretty poor, and it is slightly smelly outside, the spokesperson said. It is quite odd, I looked out the window and expected to see sunshine and it was this weird beige haze, Ive never been in a nuclear fallout but thats what it looked like. New Zealands own bushfire season has been cool and low-key this summer, and crews of Kiwi firefighters have instead been providing support to their Australian colleagues in NSW and Victoria.

With the skill of a man who made a pre-politics career of messaging, Scott Morrisons narrative is of a disaster in no way different from disasters Australians have faced in the past. A terrible event to be sure, but one from which we will recover with the resilience and Aussie spirit we have always shown during our long history of similar crises. Whatever our trials, whatever disasters have befallen us, we have never succumbed to panic. And we will not do this now in the face of the current fire crisis  The generations of Australians that went before us, including our First Australians, also faced natural disasters, floods, fires, global conflicts, disease and drought, he told us, in a New Years Eve video message.   Related: The bushfires are a national catastrophe for the city and country. How are we going to live like this? | Ross Bradstock and David Bowman   We have faced these disasters before and we have prevailed, we have overcome That is the spirit of Australians, that is the spirit that is on display, that is a spirit that we can celebrate as Australians. And so, by clear implication, suggesting that this disaster IS different becomes somehow unpatriotic, wimpy, or, perish the thought, unAustralian. Except we know that this fire disaster is unprecedented, and no amount of spin can hide it. We know it because holiday makers along the New South Wales and Victorian coast used to spend New Years Eve partying on beaches, not cowering on them to escape raging infernos. We know it because weve never experienced this choking air and this constant dread for this long, or at this scale. We know it because we have not experienced fires this fierce over this vast an area. We know it because we havent experienced the worst air quality in the world before, or this constant ominous orange sun. We know it from our lived experience and, as Guardian Australias environment editor Adam Morton detailed in this piece before Christmas, we also know it because the NSW Rural Fire Service, and scientists, and the public servants responsible for our health, all say the scale and impact of these fires is unprecedented.   Related: Australia bushfires: towns devastated and lives lost as blazes turn the sky red   Yes, weve always had fires, but not like this, and everyone knows it, no matter how diligently some news organisations compile lists of blazes from the past. And we also know why the prime minister would seek to present this catastrophe as bad, but also somehow as situation normal. If he acknowledges the fact that it is abnormal he would need to concede that global heating is part of the cause of this unprecedented situation, and that would increase pressure for Australia to do something about it, by developing a credible climate policy, instead of just pretending that we have one. So, despite the evidence all around us, the prime minister keeps recycling the spin. We wont destroy the livelihoods of Australians in the process by adopting reckless targets that force up electricity prices, now coming down under our policies, or by turning our backs on traditional industries that are especially important in regional Australia, as proposed by Labor and the Greens, his New Years message said. But were wise to the talking points, the claims about meeting and beating our emission reduction targets through creative tricks of accounting, that the renewable energy investment of which the prime minister boasts wont continue with current policies, and especially the false binary of climate action versus cost, because the costs of inaction are all too obvious. We know Australia needs a credible policy to be a force for international action rather than an impediment, no matter how loudly Angus Taylor protests that we should be proud of our policies. We dont know whether the world will succeed in limiting the heating that is contributing to this fire crisis. But we do know for sure that what we are experiencing is not situation normal. No amount of patriotic messaging about the Aussie spirit can cover the fact that we are not doing what we could be to make sure it doesnt become situation normal in the future.

The letter, released on New Years Day, describes the 2010s as the decade of division, and says the country is polarised and more fragmented than any of us would like. The heads of the British Olympic and Paralympic Associations, Scouts and Guides are among those calling for greater social integration and cohesion, and are encouraging Britons to make a new Years resolution to engage meaningfully with those around them. Our resolution is to reconnect, the letter says. To reach out to just one person we dont know, or from whom we have drifted apart. To start rebuilding connections between neighbours and fellow citizens.   Related: Brexit: Boris Johnson will have to break his promise not to extend transition, EU trade commissioner claims - as it happened   Sikh, Islamic, Jewish and Christian leaders joined the former heads of Britain Stronger in Europe and Vote Leave to call for an end to social divisions. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union and Emily Eavis, the co-organiser of the Glastonbury festival, and Kwame Kwei-Armah, the artistic director of the Young Vic; have also signed the letter, alongside the chair of the Jo Cox Foundation, Jacqui Smith. Imam Qari Asim, the chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, said a lack of integration had led to social tension. What worries me, in these polarised times, is that our growing distance from each other can breed fear of those who we dont know or are seen as different, he said. At my mosque in Leeds I see many efforts to connect with others, but I see the gaps too  people who dont have much contact with those from a different background to their own. The start of a new decade offers us a moment of change and of hope  that we can all reach out and find a connection with someone new, Asim added. His message was echoed by Right Rev Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, who said that the turn of the decade offered an opportunity to be an agent of healing in a fractured society. Yes, this is a big challenge, but we all know someone to whom we can reach out afresh. Whoever we are, we can all do our bit to rebuild for the common good, he said. The letter comes after several months of collaboration across the organisations, who wanted to put down a marker and start a conversation, according to Steve Ballinger from British Future, a thinktank focusing on issues of identity, integration, and migration. Its important to have a diverse range of voices within the letter, because if you want to improve social connection, you have to have a broad coalition and make it something for everyone, he said. Ballinger said the message was addressed to every level of society, from individuals to institutions, right up to Downing Street.  At an individual level, were hoping people will reach out to those theyve lost touch with, or never had contact with, he said. Perhaps it could be joining in with community projects, or it might simply be a smile and nod to someone in the morning. Just taking our headphones off and looking up from our phones.","548"

In his new year message, to be broadcast on BBC One at 1pm on Wednesday, Justin Welby will say: Lets go for a heroic new years resolution. Lets resolve to reconnect. To reach out to just one person we dont know, or from whom we have drifted apart. Pick one person. Pick up the phone. Send them a text. Meet them for a cup of tea. Make that connection. Lets begin cementing our unity one brick at a time. Welby recorded his message at Dover lifeboat station, saying: As we wonder how we are going to start healing some of the divisions that weve seen over recent years, the sort of people at this lifeboat station are signs of hope. More than 70 volunteers keep the lifeboat service operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The seagoing crew ranges in age from 17 to 62 and includes a student, a train driver, a chef and an electrician. When their pagers go off, day or night, theyre prepared to risk everything to rescue whoever needs their help, Welby says. We rightly think of lifeboat crews as heroic, although they may be embarrassed to hear that. Yet every time we reach out and connect with someone, it is an act of heroism. Dont underestimate it. It could be someone you know. It could be someone youve always wanted to connect with but never have. It could be someone you really disagree with. Connecting with others could involve joining a voluntary organisation or a charity, sorting donations at a food bank or joining a lifeboat crew, Welby says. When we hear someone described as a good Samaritan, we think about that person taking the time to help another. But its a story told by Jesus about someone taking the risk of reaching out to another who was very different to them. Yes, the person needed help  but they also needed connection. He says Jesus took the risk of connecting with people who were separated from him. In a forthright article marking the start of a new decade, Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said the past decade had been low and dishonest. He wrote on Viamedia: Just as in 1939 (or still earlier, in 1914), the complacent assumptions of a sunny liberalism have been shaken out. The shadows are in focus once again. Referring to a time of untruth, Bayes wrote: I do not only mean by this that our political leaders lie to us. They do, but this is not the worst of it. Worse than lying is the shamelessness that sees no sin in lying, that knows there will be no penalty to being caught lying, that pays no penalty, that systematically devalues truth in the pursuit of popular power. He went on: In a time of untruth, Christianity itself can be weaponised and distorted like everything else, made into a tool of national populism. Populist politicians in the US, Italy and Hungary were attempting to appropriate the Bible and the cross, he said. While urging the truth to be told, Bayes said: The last thing that the world needs is a harrumphing self-righteousness from Christians who do not see the glass house in which they live. He said the church was a fallen and a broken community. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, urged people to pray that the new government would strive both to create opportunities and respond to those most in need in effective and lasting ways and that businesses and financial institutions would act to strengthen bonds with and within the societies in which they operate. He further called for prayers that each of us  every person in our society  will shun all forms and expressions of hatred against others. The recent antisemitic graffiti in north London bring shame to us all. Such hatred can have no place in our way of life. Only when we see the good in each other will every person feel welcomed and unafraid.","691"
