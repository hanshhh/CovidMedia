Reuters: Police in the Chilean capital Santiago detained more than 50 protesters on Friday, saying they had violated rules intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
Protesters gathered on the Labor Day holiday in Santiagos central square, many shouting and displaying signs that railed against abuse of workers and a sharp rise in layoffs in the South American nation.
Calls to protest on social media warned those who attended the rally to use gloves, masks and alcohol gel, but police said demonstrators had failed to adhere to a nationwide rule against gatherings of more than 50 people.
The Carabineros police force said on Twitter that one of the protesters detained had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and was meant to be in isolation for another week.
Police officers clad in plastic-screened helmets and olive uniforms herded protesters into police vehicles, while water cannons mounted on trucks nearby dispersed others.
Santiago is under partial quarantine, but scattered, small protests against the government of center-right President Sebastian Pinera have persisted in areas not under lockdown.

The top US health official Dr Anthony Fauci will be prevented from testifying to a congressional committee examining the Trump administrations response to the pandemic next week, the White House has said.
The Trump administration claimed it would be counterproductive to have individuals involved in the response testify. The White House spokesman Judd Deere told Reuters:

While the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings.
We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time.

Trump said after the KCNA report that he will have something to say about Kim at the appropriate time.
There has been speculation about Kims health after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on 15 April. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state.
A source familiar with US intelligence analyses and reporting told Reuters they could not immediately confirm the KCNA report. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

According to Reuters, the news of Kim Jong-uns appearance in public is now also being reported by North Korean sources.
The state news agency KCNA says he attended the completion of a fertiliser plant in a region north of the capital, Pyongyang, on Friday.
It is the first report of his public activity since 11 April. According to KCNA, Kim cut a ribbon at the ceremony and those in attendance burst into thunderous cheers of hurrah! for the Supreme Leader who is commanding the all-people general march for accomplishing the great cause of prosperity.
Kim was accompanied by several senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo Jong, KCNA said.
Reuters said it could not independently verify the report.

Trump now hopes for fewer than 100,000 deaths

The US president Donald Trump has offered an increasingly bleak picture for the US, telling a White House event:

Hopefully, were going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless.

Trump, who initially dismissed the outbreak as a hoax, has oscillated between claiming that a death toll of between 100,000 and 200,000 people would represent a success and predicting it could be as light as 60,000 or 70,000.
According to the latest figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 62,406 people have died in the US since the outbreak began.

More than 70% of virus patients admitted to critical care are men, according to data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC).
The research was based on a sample of 7,542 critically-ill patients confirmed as having Covid-19. It showed 5,389 of the patients were men compared to 2,149 women.
The report also found that men were more likely to die in critical care, with 51% dying in care compared to around 43% of women. In total about 49% of the 5,139 patients admitted to critical care who had recorded care outcomes had died, it found.

The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn was careful to note that remdesivir has not received FDA approval as a coronavirus treatment and has only been approved for emergency use on severely ill patients who have been hospitalised.
FDA approval requires a much more lengthy review process, while an emergency use authorisation is issued more quickly after the agency weighs the potential risks and potential benefits of a treatment option to help address an emergency situation.

Todays action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective.
Theres tremendous interest among all parties to identify and arm ourselves with medicines to combat COVID-19, and through our Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, the FDA is working around-the-clock and using every tool at our disposal to speed these efforts.

More people stayed home in Brazil, Japan and Singapore in April as their numbers of cases surged, while people in the United States and Australia returned to parks and jobs as infection rates flattened, data from Google suggest.

US to allow emergency use of remdesivir for hospitalised patients

The US president Donald Trump has told reporters the drug remedesivir has been approved for emergency use to treat coronavirus patients.
The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarified that the drug had specifically been cleared for emergency use on those in hospital.
The president said the approval represented a very promising situation and the White Houses taskforce coordinator Dr Deborah Birx added: I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.
The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the governments top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial.

The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery. What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.

Albania is relaxing some of its restrictions from Monday, its prime minister Edi Rama has said.
It will enlarge its area of green zones and let taxis travel between cities. Then, from 11 May, it will allow shopping centres to open and cars to travel without permits.
While still enforcing an afternoon-to-dawn curfew, Albania has eased its restrictions this week, letting many retailers open except for bars and restaurants, though they may offer deliveries. Some people wore masks, others did not.

On 12 March, two weeks after Australia declared the coronavirus would become a pandemic and 47 days after the first case in Australia was detected in Melbourne, the World Health Organisation made it official.
That night, in Melbourne, organisers of the Australian Grand Prix were scrambling to keep the event open despite an 11th hour order from Victorias chief health officer that they could run the race but had to turn spectators away. It would be the first major event in Australia to be cancelled by the coronavirus. Within 24 hours, almost every other flagship event planned for the next month would follow suit.
This is the first 50 days of the shutdown.

Yemen has reported its first case in Taiz governorate, raising the number of diagnosed infections to seven with two deaths in the war-torn country that lacks medical care.
The United Nations says it fears the virus could be spreading undetected among an acutely malnourished population with inadequate testing capabilities. The national emergency coronavirus committee tweeted:

A new confirmed case of coronavirus was reported, the first in (southwestern) governorate of Taiz, in a man in his 40s.

Yemen recorded its first case in southern Hadharamout province on 10 April. On Wednesday, it announced five infections in the southern port of Aden, with two deaths.

Hundreds of people have gathered in a Berlin square to mark May Day in defiance of the ban on public gatherings of more than 20, exposing deep frustrations with physical distancing rules.
Reuters reports that police blocked roads around a square in Kreuzberg, traditionally the centre of left-wing May Day protests to prevent more people from joining what a police spokeswoman called an illegal gathering.
Leftist groups had called for the demonstration to denounce capitalism and urge solidarity, especially with refugees seeking to reach Europe. They had urged participants to wear masks and stay at least 1.5 metres apart.
Saving lives is not a crime, read a giant red banner dangled from a window, in a reference to the rescue ships saving refugees trying to reach Europe.
Most of those gathered appeared to be keeping a safe distance from one another. Riot police watched from a distance as a police helicopter circled overhead.
We have prevented the parade from growing bigger and are using loudspeakers to urge people to disperse, the police spokeswoman said, adding that the situation remained largely peaceful.
An overwhelming majority of Germans back the lockdown enforced by the countrys 16 states and backed by the chancellor Angela Merkel, despite its heavy toll on the economy, which is expected to contract by a record of more than 6% this year.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reiterated that the virus is of natural origin after the US presidents uncorroborated claims he had seen evidence it originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports.
Scientists believe it jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.
Trump has refused to offer any details of or evidence for his claim that he has proof that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was actually the source of the outbreak.
Asked about Trumps claim during a virtual press conference, WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan stressed that the UN health agency had listened again and again to numerous scientists who have looked at the sequences of the virus.
We are assured that this virus is natural in origin, he said, reiterating a stance the UN agency has expressed previously.

Varadkars widely expected announcement was made in a solemn address that channelled the Vera Lynn song Well Meet Again.
Varadkar announced two tweaks to restrictions that are due to expire on 5 May: the 2km limit on exercise will extend to 5km and people aged over 70 who are cocooning will be allowed to exercise outdoors.

I know its been difficult. The uncertainty about when things will get back to normal and the fear of the virus itself. As a nation, our physical health has been attacked, our mental health eroded. Our economy battered and our society put to the ultimate test.

Restrictions were working and had saved thousands of lives but progress could be swept away with premature relaxation, he said.

It will take some time for our lives to get back to normal. To a new normal. But it will happen.

The reopening will have five stages, three weeks apart, starting on 18 May. If Covid-19 surges, it may be necessary to reverse, said Varadkar.
In the first phase outdoor workers, including builders and gardeners, will be able to return to work. Hardware shops, garden centres and other selected categories will be allowed to reopen and small outdoor gatherings will be permitted. Not long from now, some summer night, we will see our friends again, said Varadkar.

US meat production has continued to decline as the coronavirus crisis forces the shutdown of more processing facilities, sparking fears of shortages at grocery stores nationwide, writes Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn.
The US Department of Agricultures weekly report found that from 27 April, beef production was down nearly 25% compared to the same time last year. Pork production was down 15%.
While Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, has said the US has plenty of food for all of [its] citizens, fewer pigs are being slaughtered at processing plants, down by nearly 50% since mid-March.
Meat processing companies have paused operations as some workers have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Last month, Tyson Foods, one of Americas largest meat producers, warned the food supply chain is breaking in a full-page ad in newspapers including the New York Times.
There will be limited supply of products, the Arkansas-based company said, until it can reopen closed facilities.

Markets slide on US-China Covid-19 trade war threat

Donald Trump threatening to reignite the US-China trade war in reaction to coronavirus has triggered a sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount, Richard Partington, the Guardians economics correspondent, reports.
Against a backdrop of rising tension between the worlds two biggest economic superpowers, share prices resumed a downward slide on Friday with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London.
Selling pressure resumed on Wall Street after recording gradual gains in recent weeks amid rising hopes a turning point had been reached for the coronavirus crisis. As fears over the economic costs from the disease mount and as the White House ramped up the threat of a renewed trade conflict with Beijing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 2% in afternoon trading in New York.
Stock prices fell sharply in Japan, with the Nikkei index of leading Japanese company shares sliding by more than 500 points, or 2.8%. Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea were closed for public holidays.
Despite world leaders starting to outline plans to lift lockdown measures more than a month on from the depths of the crisis, the economic fallout from tight controls on social and business activity during the Covid-19 outbreak are now becoming increasingly clear

A US federal judge ordered authorities to release of people from three migrant detention centres in Florida to prevent a wider spread of the coronavirus and protect detainees with underlying conditions, the Associated Press reports.
District court judge Marcia Cooke issued an order late on Thursday for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to begin the steps to bring down the number of detainees from 1,400 to about 350 within two weeks.
Two others orders were also issued on Thursday by federal judges in California and Louisiana siding with groups seeking the release of immigrants at high risk.
In Miami, seven detainees at the Krome detention centre have tested positive for Covid-19. According to court filings at least eight members of staff have also been infected there.
The judge said she found violations of the Fifth and Eight Amendments that protect due process and against unusual punishment, as conditions are worsening each day at Krome and authorities have failed at practicing social distancing at one of the other facilities.
These failures have placed petitioners at a heightened risk of not only contracting COVID-19, but also succumbing to the fatal effects of the virus as some of the petitioners have serious underlying medical illness, Cook wrote in the document. Such failures amount to cruel and unusual punishment because they are exemplary of deliberate indifference.
ICE was ordered to submit a report on Sunday with the steps to release detainees.

The US military has developed as potential breakthrough test that could identify carriers before they become infectious. Researchers hope the blood test will detect the virus about four days before current tests can.
Israel is to partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return for all students by 1 June. First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school from Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel.
US activists plan biggest rent strike in decades, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the pandemic. Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, even if they can pay.
India extended its lockdown  the worlds biggest by population  for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. 
South Africa began to ease its lockdown, with some industries allowed to reopen after five weeks. Africas most industrialised nation was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March.

Scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution as schools and playgrounds across Europe start to reopen, Kate Connolly in Berlin and Kim Willsher in Paris report.
Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said Christian Drosten, a virologist and Germanys leading coronavirus expert, who led the team.
In the current situation, we must warn against the unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens, he added.
Drostens study, which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April
He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team, including Terry Jones, a mathematician from the Centre for Pathogen Evolution at the University of Cambridge, enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus.

South Africa begins to ease lockdown

South Africa began to ease its strict coronavirus lockdown on Friday, allowing some industries to reopen after five weeks of restrictions, AFP reports. 
Africas most industrialised nation was already teetering with low growth and high debts when the lockdown kicked in on 27 March.
Its easing comes after the ratings agency S&P on Wednesday downgraded the countrys credit rating further to junk.
President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a televised May Day speech:

The poor and the working class are having to bear the burden of a global pandemic that has caused severe economic and social disruption  
As we begin the process of easing the lockdown and many people start returning to work, we must remain vigilant and careful  
The road ahead will be long and hard, and we will make mistakes.

People living in the poorest parts of the UK are dying from Covid-19 at double the rate of people in the richest areas, a data analysis has found, writes Caelainn Barr, the Guardians data projects editor.
The most deprived areas had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people  more than double that of people in the least deprived areas, where the death rate was 25.3, according to figures from England and Wales published by the Office for National Statistics on Friday.
The findings have lead to calls for the government to support the most vulnerable and prompted questions about why poorer people appear to be dying in greater numbers than the wealthy.
Javed Khan, the chief executive of Barnardos, said the crisis highlighted deep-rooted inequalities that have been papered over for decades. He went on:

Vulnerable children and families  and those already experiencing disadvantage  risk becoming the forgotten victims. Without intervention this crisis will be devastating for a whole generation  their mental health, safety, education and job prospects are on the line.
The government must ensure that the emergency funding and resources already announced reaches those in need without delay. And in the months ahead funding decisions should reflect the scale of the challenge now facing vulnerable children and families.

India extends coronavirus lockdown for two weeks

India is to extend its coronavirus lockdown - the worlds biggest by population - but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases, according to AFP.
The home ministry said in a statement that in view of significant gains in the COVID-19 situation, areas with few or no cases would see considerable relaxations.
The lockdown imposed near the end of March has caused misery for millions of workers in Indias vast informal sector and dealt a major blow to Asias third-biggest economy.
Air travel and passenger trains ground to a halt because of the lockdown and only the transport of essential goods was allowed, causing major problems as well as considerable confusion for industry and agriculture.
However the stringent restrictions have been credited with keeping confirmed cases of coronavirus to about 35,000 cases as of Friday, with 1,152 deaths.

The government said Friday that many activities will remain prohibited nationwide including air and rail travel - except for select purposes - schools, restaurants and large gatherings such as places of worship.
Restrictions are being lifted largely according to what colour an area has been assigned in a government rating system.
India is split into red zones with significant risk of spread of the infection; green zones with zero cases or no confirmed cases in the past 21 days; and those in between as orange.

An outbreak of Covid-19 among workers in a meat factory in Tipperary has raised fears that the virus is spreading through abattoirs and meat-processing plants in Ireland, writes Ella McSweeney, for the Guardians Animals Farmed project.
Sinn Fins spokesperson on agriculture, Brian Stanley, told the Irish parliament last night that 120 workers at the Rosderra Meats plant in Roscrea had tested positive for the virus. He also said that of 350 workers at the plant, up to 140 were off sick last week. Rosderra is the largest pork-processing company in Ireland.
Michael Creed, Irelands agriculture minister, told MPs that he was aware of six meat-processing plants with two or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 among workers, although he did not name them.
A spokesperson for Rosderra Meats confirmed to the Guardian that a number of employees had tested positive for coronavirus. They said that the company had implemented stringent measures to ensure the safety of employees, and added that production will be scaled down until all staff return to work.

The World Health Organizations daily coronavirus briefing is starting now. Today, the UN health agency is expected to announce a joint effort with the European Investment bank to support countries in addressing the health impact of Covid-19.
The partnership between WHO and the worlds largest international public bank is meant to boost cooperation to strengthen public health, supply of essential equipment, training and hygiene investment in countries most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO said in a release on Friday.
It will will benefit from the EIBs planned 1.4bn response to address the health, social and economic impact of COVID-19 in Africa.
Efforts will include: scaling up investment to tackle antimicrobial resistance; improving the effectiveness of malaria treatment; scaling up investment to tackle antimicrobial resistance
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said: 

Combining the public health experience of the World Health Organization and the financial expertise of the European Investment Bank will contribute to a more effective response to COVID-19 and other pressing health challenges.
WHO looks forward to strengthening cooperation with the EIB to improve access to essential supplies including medical equipment and training, and deliver better water, sanitation and hygiene where most needed. New initiatives to improve primary health care in Africa and support the EU Malaria Fund hint at the potential impact of our new partnership

Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnams successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On 28 January, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus.

Rwanda is to ease its coronavirus lockdown from Monday, allowing limited movement of people and restricted re-openings of restaurants and hotels, according to Reuters.
Movement between provinces in the central African country will still not be allowed, while schools will also remain shut until September, according to a government statement released late on Thursday.
All resumed services must adhere to health guidelines ... mask wearing and social distancing.
Rwanda alongside neighbouring Uganda implemented some of the strictest lockdown measures in Africa to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, including shuttering all but the most essential businesses.
As of Thursday it had 243 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no deaths.

US military develops breakthrough Covid-19 test

Scientists working for the US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, Giles Tremlett reports for the Guardian.
In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the viruss presence as early as 24 hours after infection  before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus.
The test has emerged from a project set up by the US militarys Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week.
The concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide, the head of Darpas biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be absolutely a gamechanger.

Riot police fanned out across Hong Kong on Friday after democracy activists threatened to defy a ban on gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic - but the streets remained largely calm, AFP reports.
Activists in the semi-autonomous financial hub, which had for months protested against a strengthening of control by Chinas government, had issued calls to muster once more on May Day - despite emergency anti-virus laws banning more than four people gathering in public.
The threat largely failed to materialise, although hundreds of protesters did however gather in small groups at a shopping mall in the town of Shatin, chanting slogans and holding protest flags.
Riot police soon rushed into the mall and used pepper spray to disperse the crowd.
One protester, a retired firefighter who gave his name as Lam, said:

I feel that the movement has been watered down because of the pandemic, but I personally think we should keep fighting. If we shrink back and accept our fate, then we will be living under an authoritarian regime.

A day after armed protesters against Michigans stay-at-home order entered the statehouse in Lansing, Donald Trump has once again expressed support for the rightwing movement, writes Joan E Greve, a Guardian US politics reporter.
Michigans Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, should, the president wrote in a tweet on Friday morning, make a deal with the demonstrators.


The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)

Some of the demonstrators in Lansing on Thursday carried assault rifles, causing alarm among legislators.
Some protesters, many without face coverings, entered the statehouse and demanded to be let on to the House floor, which is not allowed. The gallery was closed to the public to allow room for representatives and reporters to spread apart.

Cities around the world are taking the lead in post-coronavirus planning, with a raft of environmental initiatives being rolled out in places from Bogot to Barcelona to ensure public safety and bolster the fight against climate breakdown, Guardian environment correspondents Matthew Taylor and Sandra Laville report.
Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to roll out huge economic stimulus packages.
Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle.
The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future  and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution.
The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis.
The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the C40 group of cities, said: 

Our immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we must also look towards how we will keep our people safe in the future. How we structure our recovery efforts will define our cities for decades to come.

Is expecting the worst the best way to handle the coronavirus crisis?
During the pandemic, its useful to see the role your coping mechanisms play, if only to stop yourself spiralling into anxiety, writes Oliver Burkemann, a Guardian writer based in New York, in his regular column on mental wellbeing. 

Exactly how terrible are the next months and years going to be? As a generally apocalyptically minded sort of person, Ive been feeling some pride in watching my favourite question become everyone elses favourite question, too; its like being a 19th-century aristocrat and seeing your debutante daughter become the star of the London season. But in deciding who to listen to, and thus how alarmed to be, its easy to overlook a crucial factor: in a crisis as all-consuming as this one, nobody  not academic experts, not media commentators, not that one friend who keeps urging you to be less (or more) worried than you are  is a completely neutral observer. Because predictions about the future arent solely about the future. Theyre also coping mechanisms for dealing with the present.

Boris Johnson is of course no newcomer to Greece, a country he visited regularly in pre-corona times to sojourn at his fathers villa in Pelion, the peninsula off the mainland overlooking the Aegean Sea. 
Greek diplomats and politicians voice admiration for his knowledge of the classics. 
But Britains handling of the disease  its soft-touch approach and consequential catastrophic death toll - has been met with disbelief in a nation that, despite the odds has kept Covid-19 under remarkable control. 
In contrast to the 26,771 people who have succumbed to the pandemic in the UK which has registered 165,221 coronavirus cases so far, Greece has recorded 2,591 infections and a death toll of 140 after enforcing tough measures to curb the spread of the disease early on. 
Addressing reporters at his daily briefing on Thursday, the Greek health ministry spokesman and infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras spoke of victory saying incidents of the illness had clearly stabilised. 
The UK is home to a large Greek community many of whom fled to Greece before commercial air traffic was suspended in March. 
Indicative of the mood the popular Protothema newspaper reported the news of the birth of the prime ministers latest child under the headline: Johnson, father amid national sorrow over coronavirus. 
In the midst of the national sorrow that has weighed down on British society, the birth of Boris Johnsons son has once again brought his personal life, one that is as unconventional as he is, back in the public eye, the paper wrote. [A life] with two marriages, an engagement, three extra marital affairs and at least six children.

Brazils far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to fly in the face of science on Thursday when he called social isolation measures introduced by state governors and mayors useless.
He said:

We know that many people will die. Im sorry.
Seventy percent of the population will be infected and, from what it seems, from what we are seeing now, up until now all this effort to flatten the curve was practically useless. 
Whats the consequence, the collateral effect of this? Unemployment. The people want to go back to work.

The president has consistently sought to downplay the impacts of the pandemic, arguing that Brazilians would be immune because they jump in sewage, and mixing with supporters. 
Brazil has 85,380 confirmed cases and 5,901 deaths with 435 reported in the last 24 hours as numbers accelerate.
His new health minister, Nelson Teich, earlier contradicted this view. You cant start freeing things up when you have a curve that is frankly ascending, he said.
While there are no definitive studies about the impact of social isolation on the growth of Brazils cases, experts believe it has had a positive impact. 
The worst-hit state of So Paulo, for instance, was supposed to see a peak in April but this has now been moved to May, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported.
Brazil had flattened the curve, yes, with isolation measures, but in the last two weeks we are seeing a loosening of isolation and what we are seeing is a new acceleration of the epidemic, Fernando Bozza,a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro who is modelling the pandemic, told the Guardian.

Malaysia on Friday detained hundreds of refugees and migrant workers for illegally living in the country, rights groups said, at a time of movement and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. 
Malaysia has around two million registered foreign workers but authorities estimate many more are living in the Southeast Asian country without proper documents. 
Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as illegal migrants. 
The arrests followed immigration raids in a neighbourhood in capital Kuala Lumpur where thousands of migrant workers and refugees live, according to human rights groups and photos shared on social media. 
Human Rights Watch and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network said over 700 migrants were taken into custody including young children. 
Malaysian police and the immigration department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Rachel Tan, programme officer at the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, said the arrests were a criminalisation of a people who toil in difficult and dangerous work conditions. 
The neighbourhood where the raids took place was close to an area with three buildings that had been placed under strict lockdowns last month after a surge in coronavirus cases there. 
Malaysia has reported a total of 6,071 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths, and its prime minister said on Friday that most businesses will reopen from Monday following six-week long curbs that have caused a damaging economic slowdown.

Big Macs delivered on meal trolleys, hand washing stations at the entrance and designated waiting spots to separate customers could become a feature of McDonalds restaurants in the Netherlands when they are allowed to reopen. 
In a trial at a restaurant in the city of Arnhem, McDonalds has been looking for ways to maintain social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is relaxed. 
McDonalds Netherlands spokeswoman Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters:

We have tried to figure out how to keep our customers and employees safe, while maintaining a restaurant atmosphere. 
These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers dont notice them too much.

 Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since 15 March.
But new infections have been dropping, prompting calls to loosen the lockdown after its current deadline of 19 May. 
A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around 12 May, but the prime minister, Mark Rutte, has ruled out a return to normal. 
If they do reopen, they will have to keep customers and staff at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to avoid a new wave of infections. 
McDonalds says it could introduce table service, with burgers and fries wheeled to customers on trolleys from which they can pick up their orders. 
Other new features would include hand-washing stations at the entrance and a host behind a plastic screen showing customers their place in line.

Many restaurant owners in the Netherlands fear social distancing will simply put them out of business. 
But McDonalds expects its new set-up will work at 180 larger restaurants out of its 252 franchises in the country. 
 Koekkoek said: 

On average this will allow us to serve around 66% of our normal number of customers.
We dont expect reopening to be allowed before June. 
But even then, we will move in steps. Readjusting 180 restaurants is a tall order.

The Hungarian budget carrier, Wizz Air, flew into Londons Luton airport from Sofia on Friday, becoming one of the first European airlines to restart routes during the coronavirus pandemic. 
At least one person onboard seen through the window was wearing a face mask.

There were also dozens of passengers within the airport, spaced out for social distancing, possibly for the return flight which took off shortly afterwards. 
European airlines have grounded the majority of their fleets over the last six weeks as governments imposed travel restrictions to combat the spread of the virus. 
But Wizz Air said last week it planned to put some of its planes back in the air for essential travel, restoring services to destinations in Romania, Budapest in Hungary, Lisbon in Portugal and Spains Tenerife plus a few more. 
The London Luton arrivals and departures board showed three Wizz Air flights were due to arrive and depart on Friday. 
The airline says it is important to get the infrastructure operating and that there are people across Europe who need to travel for work.

 Across Europe, air traffic is down by about 90% according to global body IATA, with the flights that are still operating facilitating the repatriation of citizens, travel by medical experts and cargo supplies. 
Given ongoing travel restrictions - UK government advice for example is for Britons to avoid all non-essential global travel and Wizz has said that it does not expect flights to be full, enabling it to maintain social distancing onboard. 
The airline, whose geographic focus is on central and eastern Europe, has said all passengers must wear masks on flights while its crew will wear masks and gloves. 
When travel restrictions do start to ease, it is likely that there will be tougher measures for flying, which could affect demand. 
Britain is considering a two-week quarantine requirement for arrivals into the country.

US hands $50m Covid-19 aid to fossil fuel firms

US fossil fuel companies have taken at least $50m in taxpayer money they likely wont have to pay back, according to a review of coronavirus aid meant for struggling small businesses by the investigative research group Documented and the Guardian, writes Guardian US environment reporter Emily Holden in Washington.
A total of $28m is going to three coal mining companies, including two with ties to Trump officials, bolstering a dying American industry and a fuel that scientists insist world leaders must shift away from to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. The other $22m is being paid out to oil and gas services and equipment providers and other firms that work with drillers and coal miners.
Melinda Pierce, the legislative director for the Sierra Club, said: 

The federal money Congress appropriated should be going to help small businesses and frontline workers struggling as a result of the pandemic, not the corporate polluters whose struggles are a result of failing business practices and existed long before Covid-19 entered the public lexicon.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has risen by 475 to 39,791 health authorities said on Friday, with 98 new deaths. 
 The countrys death toll stands at 4,893, the Dutch institute for public health and the environment (RIVM) said in its daily update. 
 The RIVM cautioned it only reports confirmed cases, and actual numbers are higher. But it said the latest figures are in line with the impression that the measures [taken to deal with the outbreak] are working, adding:

The number of new hospital admissions reported per day is still decreasing. The same applies to the number of reported deaths.

The country is on course to reopen primary schools on 11 May, with secondary schools planned to reopen the following month.

The worlds largest public service union federation, Public Services International, has launched a 12-hour virtual May Day live stream to celebrate the public service workers who are keeping society going during the coronavirus pandemic. 
With more than 600 affiliated unions, PSI represents more than 20 million workers in 180 countries. They are calling on unions and workers across the world to take action from their homes rather than in the streets. In a blog posted to their website today, PSI general secretary, Rosa Pavanelli, said:

This May Day, for the first time in a century, workers wont be in the streets. Theyre busy saving the world. Theyre keeping our relatives on life support. Theyre keeping food systems flowing. They are risking their lives to save lives - not as heroes, but as professionals. As Trade Unions, the only way we can do justice to these momentous efforts is by winning the deep, systemic change which workers, now more than ever, need and deserve.

Anyone who wants to take part is encouraged to post a solidarity message to frontline workers to social media, using the hashtag #VirtualMayDay, or chat join the live chat on the stream on Vimeo or Facebook.

By eschewing the kinds of lockdowns seen elsewhere in the world, Sweden has taken a different and controversial approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic. That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University. She asks: has Swedens coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists?

Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 mortality rate is among the 10 highest in the world, at 240 per million population and steadily rising, and many of the nursing homes in Stockholm are now affected.
The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The countrys chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.
But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of the bent twig, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it.

Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the UK because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat, Anna Fazackerly reports for the Guardian.
Student groups representing the students, from across Britain, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities. Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs.
The Indian National Students Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food.
Charan Sekhon, the chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: We have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They havent got anything at all to eat.
India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around 300 were selling for 2,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain.

Singapore has begun moving migrant workers who have recovered from coronavirus infections to two cruise ships in an effort to curb its spread in workers dormitories, AFP reports. 
After taking swift and aggressive measures that initially controlled its outbreak, Singapore has been hit by a bigger second wave among the work permit holders who carry out many of the basic services that keep the city running.
On Friday, Singapores ministry of health reported 932 new infections, the majority of which were among migrant workers, who are housed in sprawling dormitory complexes. Just five cases were found among Singapore nationals or so-called permanent residents. So far it has reported 17,101 cases but just 15 deaths.
A group of migrant workers boarded the SuperStar Gemini, a mid-sized cruise ship, on Wednesday, and another vessel, the SuperStar Aquarius, is ready to receive more after undergoing assessments by government agencies, the Singapore Tourism Board said on Friday.
Together, the vessels can accommodate up to 2,000.

Fifteen people have been arrested in Istanbul, Turkey, for trying to stage a May Day march in defiance of coronavirus lockdown measures, according to the Associated Press. 
The Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey, or DISK, tweeted that its head Arzu Cerkezoglu and several other union leaders were detained near Taksim Square, where they wanted to lay wreaths of carnations.
The Istanbul governors office said the demonstrators were later released. The statement added that various trade unions had left wreaths in Taksim Square, as permitted by the governors office, but that DISK had insisted on collectively marching to the square, which was in breach of lockdown and social distancing rules.

Taksim Square holds a symbolic value for Turkeys labour movement. In 1977, 34 people were killed there during a May Day event when shots were fired into the crowd from a nearby building.
Turkey has imposed partial lockdowns in 31 provinces every weekend and on national holidays. Exemptions apply, including for many labourers who continue to work amid the pandemic. 
The ban on May Day demonstrations in Taksim has been in effect for several years, due to security concerns. Police closed all roads leading to Taksim Square with barricades and increased security presence Friday.
Turkey ranks seventh in the world for the number of confirmed infections with 120,204 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, although experts believe the actual toll of the pandemic is higher than the tally. The countrys official death toll stands at 3,174.

Summary

Here are the latest headlines in our international coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. 

Chinas Hubei province will lower its coronavirus emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level. The announcement follows months of strict lockdown. The virus was first detected in the provinces capital, Wuhan, in late 2019.
Deprived areas of England and Wales have double the death rates of affluent areas. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April, an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas, figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed. 
Russia reported 7,933 new cases of Covid-19 in a record daily rise, bringing the nationwide tally to 114,431. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,169 after 96 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours, Russias coronavirus crisis response centre said.
Ryanair is to cut 3,000 jobs reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights. The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. 
Queensland, Australia, cleared way for the National Rugby League season to restart. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has opened the state border in preparation for restart of the National Rugby League (NRL) season on 28 May. 
One million people have recovered from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Infections worldwide stand at 3,269,667. More than 233,700 people have died in the pandemic so far.
Trump claimed he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab. When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a high degree of confidence that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: Yes, I have. His own government experts say the virus was not manmade or genetically modified.

Israel to partially reopen schools next week

Israels government just announced the country will partially reopen schools on Sunday, with a full return to for all students by 1 June, reports Oliver Holmes, the Guardians Jerusalem correspondent.
First, second and third graders as well as 11th and 12th graders can return to school as of Sunday, the first day of the week in Israel.
Childcare and kindergartens, ages zero to six, will remain closed for at least another week, the government said.
Despite seeing a drop in the number of daily virus infections during the past few days, the reopening of schools has been a contentious issue in Israel, with fierce debate within the government around whether it was a premature step.
Following Fridays announcement, the mayor of Tel Aviv said he would not allow schools to open there.
Ron Huldai was quoted by Haaretz newspaper as saying the plan doesnt ensure the wellbeing and health of the children.
A partial reopening has also been criticised by parents of children of different ages who will still not be able to work.
The country has 15,946 total confirmed cases and 223 deaths.

A report by Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) yesterday heighten concerns among US officials and lawmakers that the pandemic threatens to derail stalled US-led peace efforts, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports.The spread of COVID-19 already has significantly impacted Afghanistan, the report said, from complicating the peace initiative to forcing border crossing closures that have disrupted commercial and humanitarian deliveries.Afghanistans numerous and, in some cases, unique vulnerabilities - a weak health-care system, widespread malnutrition, porous borders, massive internal displacement, contiguity with Iran, and ongoing conflict - make it likely the country will confront a health disaster in the coming months, the report said.Meanwhile Save the Children announced yesterday that around seven million children are at risk of hunger due to the lockdowns following spread Coronavirus in Afghanistan.At a time when Afghan children need adequate daily nutrition to help strengthen their immune systems to fight the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the price of basic foods is rising under the lockdown, making it harder for families to feed themselves, the report said.The organization also warned that a third of the country will face food shortages.A third of the population  including 7.3 million children  will face food shortages in April and May due to the current pandemic, the organisation said.According to the organisation, even before the global COVID-19 crisis, the total number of children who needed some form of humanitarian support this year stood at 5.26 million, making war-torn Afghanistan one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child.

Frances education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, is today expected to announce strict rules for the reopening of crches, nursery and primary schools later this month, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardians Paris correspondent. 
A provisional document seen by Le Monde and AFP suggests rules will be strict in applying accepted barrier and social distancing regulations, but it has already been declared unworkable by teachers, especially for classes of younger children. 
Teachers are expected to return on 11 May to prepare for the restarting of classes the following day.

The draft health protocol says children must wash their hands on arrival at school, before and after visiting lavatories, before and after each meal, after playtime, after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing and touching shared objects and before going home. Taps and running water are to be preferred but sanitising gel must be provided if this is not possible. 
Ball games and contact games are banned and there is to be no exchange of personal objects. If more than one child touches an object it should be disinfected.
There must be staggered recreation and play breaks, and limited changes of room  French children tend to take different subjects in different classes  as well a one-way system organised in school buildings so pupils can maintain a 1-metre minimum distance from each other. Classes to be regularly disinfected and aired and doors left open to avoid pupils touching handles. 
The wearing of masks is not obligatory for nursery school children, but is advised, and staff must wear masks.
There will also be a limit to the number of children in each class reportedly 10 children for those in crches and nurseries, and 15 in primary schools.
It must be stressed these are details in the provisional protocol, which needs to be confirmed by the education minister today. 
The two lowest years in secondary schools will start back the following week, on 18 May. A decision on other years will be made at the end of May for a possible return to class on 2 June.
Another unknown factor is what say local mayors will have in deciding whether schools in their areas should reopen or if restarting classes poses too much of a risk, particularly in areas designated red, where the virus is circulating.

Japan extends state of emergency for a month

Japan is preparing for a month-long extension to its coronavirus state of emergency, prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday. 
Abe imposed an initial month-long emergency for seven regions on 7 April, before subsequently expanding it across the whole country. 
With measures due to expire next week, Abe said he had told his minister responsible for handling the outbreak, Yasutoshi Nishimura, to plan for an extension, AFP reports. 
He was quoted as saying: 

After receiving [a] report from the panel of experts, I asked Minister Nishimura to use extending the current framework of the state of emergency by about one month as the base scenario for swiftly drafting plans that will fit the needs of the regions

An extension of the state of emergency had been widely expected, despite the comparatively small scale of the outbreak in Japan, with nearly 14,300 infections recorded and 432 deaths so far.

US activists plan biggest rent strike in decades

Thousands of people in the US plan to take part in a rent strike on Friday, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the coronavirus crisis, writes Guardian US reporter Adam Gabbatt.
Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, whether they are able to pay or not, to draw attention to the plight of those unable to pay.
The protest is expected to represent the largest coordinated rent strike in America in decades, and comes as the labor department announced another 3.8 million people lost their jobs last week, with pressure growing on state leaders nationwide to increase their efforts on housing.

More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks, as the coronavirus has caused widespread business closures.
The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among those voicing support for the strikes, which are being coordinated by an array of housing groups.
People arent striking because they dont feel like paying rent, theyre striking because they cant, Ocasio-Cortez said.

Hundreds of workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores, Target retail stores, and shoppers at Instacart and Shipt called out sick on Friday as part of a coordinated one-day strike across the US in protest of working conditions and inadequate safety protections during the coronavirus pandemic.
The 1 May walkout began after Amazon ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy for workers at the end of April.
The fact they took it away prior to the sick-out lets you know theyre aware of the sick-out and trying to stop people from participating in that, said Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, who has worked at Amazon for more than four years. Now theyre forcing people to go to work because if you run out of unpaid time off, thats it, youre fired.
Palmer was one of the workers who participated in protests outside of JFK8 warehouse a few weeks ago in demand of safety protections for Amazon workers. An assistant manager at JFK8, Chris Smalls, was fired shortly after he organised the protest.
Palmer said that after the protests, Amazon began providing personal protective equipment to workers and enforcing social distancing rules and temperature checks, but he said cleaning procedures remain inadequate.

Heres more information on Australias road to recovery by Guardian reporter Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst.
Scott Morrison has offered Australians an early mark to ease Covid-19 restrictions next week while warning a return to normality will depend on uptake of the Covidsafe contact tracing app.
The prime minister dangled the prospect of a potential loosening of the rules next Friday as he issued his strongest declaration yet that it was conditional on more downloads.
Morrison also revealed that net overseas migration is down 30% and is expected to fall by 80% in 2020-21, both compared with 2018-19, in a sign the economic contraction from Covid-19 will last much longer than restrictions to social life. Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank both estimate that unemployment is set to top 10%.
The first restrictions were eased this week with New South Wales allowing visits to friends and relatives, and a similar measure announced on Friday in the Australian Capital Territory, the first Australian jurisdiction with no active cases.

Frances state-owned SNCF railways company estimates it will lose at least 3bn (2.6bn) in revenue as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Les Echos daily newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.
Reuters reports the group has been running only 7% of its high-speed trains and 20% of regional services since mid-March and will be allowed to resume only about 30% of its network from 11 May as France seeks to manage the post-lockdown period.
Les Echos newspaper said strikes over government pension reforms that started in early December in France has already cost the company 1bn in lost revenue.
The newspaper said the company lost 700m in March, 1.4bn in April and expects losses to reach 3bn before a nationwide lockdown begins to ease from 11 May.

Ryanair to cut 3,000 jobs as coronavirus grounds flights

Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights.
The no-frills airline said it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest.
As part of a programme of sweeping cost cuts, Ryanair said it could close a number of bases across Europe until air travel recovers.

Migrant workers on Spanish farms that provide fruit and vegetables for UK supermarkets are trapped in dire conditions under lockdown, living in cardboard and plastic shelters without food or running water.
Thousands of workers, many of them undocumented, live in settlements between huge greenhouses on farms in the southern Spanish provinces of Huelva and Almeria, key regions for European supply chains.
Local union activists have been supporting the migrants, bringing them water, food and basic supplies since Spain declared a lockdown in mid March.
Clare Carlile from Ethical Consumer, a UK charity supporting the local activists, says the situation is the result of years of neglect of workers.
They got visited by the Spanish army on 18 March and told to stay put, even though in some places running water is several kilometres away. Now, with Covid fears, a water truck comes twice a week. If you are at work and miss it you must walk several kilometres for water after a hard day.
Failure of employers provide basic rights has for years created dire circumstances for the inhabitants of the settlements. Now, the pandemic has pushed the situation to crisis point.

Carmela Fonbuena reports for the Guardian: 
Philippine provinces considered to have a low to moderate number of coronavirus cases began easing lockdowns on Friday 1 May, amid concerns from local officials and residents who are wary that the real scale of the outbreak cannot be known until the country conducts more testing. 
Many provinces are still just seeing imported cases from other areas. When [strict lockdowns are] lifted they expect imported cases to come in, said former health secretary Manuel Dayrit. 
The rules remain unclear. The government initially said religious gatherings will be allowed provided physical distancing is observed, but its now under review following concerns raised.

The Philippines recorded 8,488 cases as of 30 April, including 568 deaths. The numbers are believed to be higher as the country of 110 million people has tested less than 100,000 individuals. Its a testament to its poor healthcare system as many hospitals struggle to meet requirements for coronavirus testing. The decision made by a national government taskforce on coronavirus put several local officials in a difficult position. In the provinces of Ilocos Norte, La Union, and Albay, where residents oppose the government decision, local leaders cannot extend strict lockdowns without government approval. Lifting will only return the virus into a second wave, said Joey Salceda, a lawmaker from Albay province, which recorded three deaths among total 28 cases but he is afraid there are undetected cases.Metro Manila will remain in strict lockdown but certain restrictions will be lifted to allow some government infrastructure work to continue. Groups of overseas Filipino workers stranded in the capital due to provincial lockdowns have been allowed go home, too.

Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: 

1 million people have recovered from coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins University data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total at 1,014,524. Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570. More than 233,300 people have died in the pandemic so far.
Boris Johnson says UK past the peak. The prime minister promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, Johnson suggested the worst was over.
US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population. Thirty million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since 21 March. The White House let its two-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports.
Trump claims he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab. When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a high degree of confidence that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Donald Trump replied: Yes, I have. His own government experts say the virus was not manmade or genetically modified. US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs. Australias prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said of the lab theory: What we have before us doesnt suggest that is a likely source.
Protesters, some armed, gather inside Michigan state capitol. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigans state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governors request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. 
Major US airlines will require passengers to cover their faces during flights. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said on Thursday they will soon require passengers to cover their faces during flights, following the lead of JetBlue Airways, Reuters reports. 
British BAME Covid-19 death rate more than twice that of whites. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies.
UK food banks face record demand. The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals.
Jacinda Arderns popularity surges during lockdown. An opinion poll in New Zealand has found the prime ministers approval rating jumped to 65% during the countrys nearly five-week strict lockdown. It puts her in a strong position ahead of this years general election. Her Labour party also did well, achieving a 55% approval rating.

Australia has earned an early mark
Australia has brought forward its decision on easing restrictions to next Friday 8 May in a further sign that the country is successfully flattening the curve. 
Australia, which in late March recorded around 400 new cases of the virus a day, now consistently has fewer than 20 new cases daily. Restrictions on movement were put into place at the end of March, including the closure of schools in some states, as well as restaurants, pubs and some businesses, as well as restrictions on the number of people who can gather together. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison was due to announce which of these restrictions would be lifted on 11 May after discussion with state premiers, but says the announcement has been brought forward three days, with a cheerful Morrison telling a press conference on Friday that Australians have earned an early mark.
He added that we didnt expect to be in this position six weeks ago.

Australias chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Australia will begin testing cohorts of asymptomatic people in an attempt to ensure early detection of any new outbreaks and avoid a second wave. That cluster testing will be focused on groups that have a high risk of exposure or work with vulnerable people, like aged care workers or healthcare workers. Teachers are among those who might get tested.
Says Murphy:

We need to test more people. If we are going to get on top of those small outbreaks ... we cannot afford to have an outbreak that takes off so that we get a second wave when we reduce restrictions such as a number of other countries have seen. So our testing has to be very good.

He says that the case data shows that most people who transmit the virus do still have symptoms, so anyone with any symptoms should get tested.

The most important thing in testing is for anyone who has respiratory symptoms, a cough or a cold or a sore throat, to get tested ... get tested and dont go to work.

Cholera and coronavirus: why we must not repeat the same mistakes
Coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.
While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is addressing the media now. 
He has been asked about US President Donald Trumps comments late on Thursday. Trump said he had seen evidence that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, contradicting experts in his own administration who said it was not man made or genetically modified. 
Morrison said he has not seen any evidence to suggest thats the case, but says Australia is still pushing for an independent investigation into the origin of the disease.

What we have before us doesnt suggest that that is the likely source. Theres nothing that we have that would suggest that that is the likely source but you cant rule anything out in this scenario.

He says the virus did originate in Wuhan, but the most likely scenario that has been canvassed related to wildlife wet markets.
That is why Australia wants an objective independent investigation, he says.

While that cant be ruled out its not something we have seen any hard evidence of that that is the position.

Morrison says an independent investigation would look at what happened and why it happened.

So we can learn if something similar could happen in any part of the world so the world will be able to respond quicker. Because clearly in these cases time is everything.

Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria
Governments were caught out when Covid-19 hit, having overlooked the need to be able to test for new diseases because they were focused on drugs and vaccines for those they already knew about.
Now there are fears that the rush to supply wealthier countries pressing for more tests may destabilise the fight against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, illnesses that kill millions, mostly in low- and middle-income countries.
Some companies are planning to reduce or stop malaria, HIV and TB test production, said Dr Catharina Boehme, the chief executive of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find) and an adviser to the World Health Organization. They are shifting their production to Covid-19 tests.
Boehme said companies could get about 18 cents for a rapid malaria test and $10 for a Covid-19 test.
The Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria said it was concerned about any action that might reduce the availability of tests or treatment for HIV, TB or malaria

The eels at a Japanese aquarium are lonely  and the aquarium staff are urging people to video call the creatures so that they do not grow too shy, AFP reports.

The Sumida Aquarium, housed in the landmark Tokyo Skytree tower, has been closed since the start of March and its animals have become used to a largely human-free environment during the two-month calm.
The unprecedented situation was having some unexpected downsides.
Creatures in the aquarium dont see humans except keepers and they have started forgetting about humans, it said on its Twitter account this week. Garden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by.
That is causing difficulties for keepers trying to check on the health of the animals.
In a bid to reacquaint the eels with humans, the aquarium is setting up five tablets facing the tank housing the delicate creatures, with eel enthusiasts asked to connect through iPhones or iPads via the FaceTime app.
Once the video calls start, people are supposed to show their faces, wave and talk to the eels. But given the tender nature of the animals, callers are asked not to shout.

Whistleblower complaint set to lift lid on Trump pressure to push untried drug
Donald Trumps musing over whether cleaning peoples lungs with disinfectant might treat the coronavirus caused a furore but it may be the US presidents pushing of anti-malarial drugs that does far more lasting damage to his administration.
There is building anticipation over the content of an upcoming whistleblower complaint by Dr Rick Bright, who last week was abruptly removed as the head of the federal government office working on a vaccine for Covid-19.
It is understood that Bright is still working on the details of the complaint before lodging it with the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general.
Bright, a vaccines expert, has claimed he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) because he resisted an effort to expand the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19. The drugs, approved to treat malaria, have yet to be proven effective for this new use but have been repeatedly promoted by Trump, who has called them a game-changer.

Tony Allen, legendary drummer and Afrobeat co-founder, dies aged 79
The Nigerian drummer Tony Allen, who is credited with creating Afrobeat along with his old bandmate Fela Kuti, died suddenly at the age of 79 in Paris on Thursday, his manager said.
We dont know the exact cause of death, Eric Trosset said, adding it was not linked to the coronavirus.
He was in great shape, it was quite sudden. I spoke to him at 1pm then two hours later he was sick and taken to Pompidou hospital, where he died.
Allen was the drummer and musical director of Fela Kutis band Africa 70 in the 1960s and 70s, AFP reports. 


RIP Tony Allen, the drums behind Fela's earth-shattering groove, the Clyde Stubblefield of Afro-Beat but much more. His evolution continued to the very end, experimenting with jazz, house, and the fusion of The Good, Bad and the Queen. Rest in polyrhythm. https://t.co/ie9VdVlV8Y Otto Von Biz Markie (@Passionweiss)

During that time the pair created Afrobeat, combining west African musical styles such as highlife and fuji music with US jazz and funk. Afrobeat went on to become one of the totemic genres of 20th century African music.
Over Allens thrilling beat, Kuti laid out his revolutionary and pan-African message, which led him to become one of the abiding icons of the struggle for freedom across the continent.

US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population

The White House let its 2-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. 
The enormous pressure on states to reopen, despite a lack of wide-scale virus testing and other safeguards urged by health experts, was highlighted in new Labor Department data showing some 30 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since 21 March.

The jobless toll amounts to more than 18.4% of the US working-age population, a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Physical separation of people - by closing schools, businesses and other places of social gatherings - remains the chief weapon against a highly contagious respiratory virus with no vaccine and no cure.But with economic pain reaching historic proportions, agitation to relax stay-at-home orders and mandatory workplace restrictions has mounted.For the second time in two weeks, hundreds of protesters - including armed militia group members - thronged Michigans state Capitol in Lansing demanding an end to Governor Gretchen Whitmers stay-at-home orders.The latest protest was sparked by the Democratic governors request, ignored by Republican lawmakers, to extend emergency powers she had invoked in a state hard hit by both the virus and closures to combat it.

Dan Collyns reports for the Guardian from Lima: 
Municipal authorities in Peru shut down a bustling street market in Lima on Thursday after a spot test for Covid-19 revealed one in five stallholders were infected with the virus. 
Out of 842 stallholders, 163 tested positive for the virus when a team of medics with military backup descended on the Caquta food market in the working-class San Martn de Porres district in downtown Lima on Wednesday.

Most Peruvians shop in open-air or covered food markets rather than supermarkets, where prices are more negotiable and markedly cheaper. But social distancing and sanitary guidelines are regularly flouted as punters haggle for bargains and stallholders make special offers to attract more customers.
Markets were hot spots for Covid-19, Perus defence minister Walter Martos told journalists as he took part in the surprise inspection on Wednesday which revealed the virus increasing hold on the countrys population even as a stringent lockdown was nearing the end of its seventh week.
We know that this market is major convergence point and we have seen on our hotspots map that around this market theres a large number of infected [people], Martos said.
Perus President Martn Vizcarra said it was a stern warning to maintain social distancing: These 163 [stallholders] have to stay at home and keep their distance to avoid infecting others.
When you go to buy potatoes or lettuce, you could be taking Covid-19 into your homes as an extra, he said, using the Quechua word Yapa, which means a bonus portion offered to loyal customers.
President Vizcarra has been praised by Peruvians for his swift and decisive response to Covid-19 enforcing one of the earliest lockdowns in Latin America. Nonetheless, the Andean countrys curve of infection has continued to rise and it had Latin Americas second-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases after Brazil, with 36,976 confirmed cases and 1,051 deaths on Thursday.
Poverty has been a major obstacle to the enforcement of the lockdown. Thousands have been trying to leave Lima in recent weeks, many saying they had to choose between hunger or homelessness in the city or the risk of exposure to Covid-19 as they attempt to return to their rural hometowns.

Jair Bolsonaro says footballers in Brazil have a small chance of dying from Covid-19
Brazils president Jair Bolsonaro wants to see football competitions restart soon despite the countrys high number of coronavirus cases, arguing that players are less likely to die from Covid-19 because of their physical fitness, Associated Press reports. 
Bolsonaro is one of the few world leaders that still downplays the risks brought by the coronavirus, which he has likened to a little flu.
Most leagues in Brazil were suspended on 15 March. The Brazilian championship was scheduled to begin in May, but that looks unlikely as the country has become a coronavirus hot spot with more than 5,900 deaths. Doctors say the peak of the pandemic is expected to hit within two weeks.
Brazils president said his new health minister will issue a suggestion that games return without any fans in the stadiums, but he acknowledged many players might be reluctant.
The decision to restart soccer is not mine, but we can help, Bolsonaro said, adding he has spoken with Gremio coach Renato Portaluppi about the issue and was told that players are still worried about the virus.
Neighbouring Argentina has already cancelled the rest of the 2019-2020 season because of the pandemic. France also decided to end the season, declaring Paris Saint-Germain as league champions on Thursday.

Such dim prospects, even after the lockdown is lifted, threaten the box-office takings that make up 60% of industry earnings, spurring producers to say big-budget films and extravagant shoots in foreign locations will be shelved.Bollywood has come to a grinding halt, with film production and theatres shut nationwide, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a 40-day lockdown to curb the virus, which has infected 31,000 people and killed more than 1,000 in India.About 9,500 theatres are shut, and business at multiplexes and single-screen cinemas is unlikely to bounce back for weeks or even months, as infection fears linger and discretionary spending plunges.Shares in Indias two largest multiplex operators, PVR and INOX Leisure, have plunged more than 40% from all-time highs in late February.Brokerage Emkay also slashed its rating on both to hold from buy, saying they would suffer declines of more than 50% in visitor numbers, ticket sales, advertising revenue and food and beverage sales in fiscal 2020-21.

Trump claims to have evidence coronavirus started in Chinese lab but offers no details
Donald Trump claimed to have seen evidence to substantiate the unproven theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite US intelligence agencies conclusion that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified.
Were going to see where it comes from, Trump said at a White House event on Thursday. We have people looking at it very, very strongly. Scientific people, intelligence people, and others. Were going to put it all together. I think we will have a very good answer eventually. And China might even tell us.
Pressed to explain what evidence he had seen that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, Trump responded, I cant tell you that. Im not allowed to tell you that.
Prior to the White House event, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of US spy agencies, issued a statement asserting that the intelligence community concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.
The intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, the statement added.

Ms Du, door sensors and me: life with a Beijing Covid-19 quarantine handler
Every day for the last two weeks I have spoken with Ms Du, a mild-mannered, middle-aged woman who is my quarantine handler.
She calls me in the morning to remind me to send her my temperature. She calls again if I forget to send the afternoon reading. She texts rose emojis, reminding me to please cooperate with the rules. If I open my door, equipped with a sensor, to put the rubbish in the hall or pick up a delivery, she immediately calls and reminds me to let her know beforehand.
After returning from a reporting trip to Wuhan, I have been in strict self-isolation in my apartment in Beijing. Most days I get calls not just from Du but the local police station, perhaps checking the spelling of my name, someone from the health department asking about my travel history, or other representatives from the neighbourhood committee.
They send messages reminding me to cover my mouth when coughing and not to spit wherever you please. The calls and questions, politely made, are constant and after a few days I already feel harried. A pink slip of paper with hearts taped to my door alerts my neighbours how long my quarantine should last:

Remdesivir: five Australian hospitals to receive experimental coronavirus drug
The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental Covid-19 drug remdesivir.
The only confirmed location is St Vincents hospital in Sydney, a major tertiary hospital and the centre of many of the New South Wales outbreak areas. A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the health department has been engaging with Gilead on gaining access to the drug for Covid-19 patients.
The news comes as the doctor informing the Covid-19 response in the White House, the immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, promoted preliminary findings from a joint Gilead and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that suggested remdesivir could improve recovery time of patients. His comments have revived global hope in the drug, with no treatments now available for the virus.

British BAME Covid-19 death rate 'more than twice that of whites'

The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies.
The highly respected thinktank also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons.
NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities.

The Trussell Trust, the UKs biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume.
A similar picture emerged from the Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan), which said its food banks recorded a 59% increase in demand for emergency food support between February and March  17 times higher than the same period a year ago.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday that downstate New Yorks entire public transport system (which includes New York City and Long Island) would be disinfected every 24 hours. 
He also said he would need an army of between 6,400 and 17,000 people to trace the contacts of people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus as part of a strategy to limit outbreaks.Cuomo said that former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg would, in coordination with Johns Hopkins University, oversee the recruitment and training of these contact tracers and make the program available to governments worldwide.

"2020-05-01T23:47:27Z","australia-news","Australia news","ICYMI: Australian news you may have missed this week during the coronavirus crisis","As Australias coronavirus outbreak continues, a lot of important news has slipped under the radar. From Angus Taylor v Clover Moore, to a looming byelection, and back to the Taylor familys Grasslands saga, here are the stories you may have missed over the past week. And here is last weeks list of stories  in case you missed those. New details emerge in Angus Taylor document saga After police told New South Wales parliament there was no evidence Angus Taylors office had a downloaded an altered City of Sydney document from the councils website, the ministers response was to make a distinction between downloading and accessing. Last year, Taylor used the false document, which contained incorrect figures on council travel, to attack the City of Sydney mayor, Clover Moore, and maintained he had accessed from the councils website. It emerged this week that NSW police had told the state parliament there was no evidence the documents had been downloaded from the council website, leading to Taylors distinction between download and accessing. Moore, who was also concerned by reports Taylor was not interviewed by police, said it was nearly beyond belief Taylor had still not explained the origin of the altered document. Obama White House team watched Gillards misogyny speech  a lot In an interview with the podcast A Rational Fear, Obama White House adviser Ben Rhodes revealed the former presidents team would often watch Julia Gillards misogyny speech when they were really annoyed with Tony Abbott. Rhodes, Obamas former deputy national security adviser, said the team was often frustrated with the former Coalition PM over his positions on climate change, particularly during the lead-up to the Paris agreement. He did not say whether the former president was among the viewers of Gillards speech. In the podcast, Rhodes also revealed how Obama went way off the script to blast the Abbott government during a visit to Brisbane for the G20 summit. Investigation finds Taylor-linked company poisoned endangered grasslands A much-anticipated report by the federal environment department concluded a company part-owned by Angus Taylor illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands in the New South Wales Monaro region. Jam Land, which Taylor part-owns with his brother Richard, was ordered to restore 103 hectares of native grassland three and a half years after poisoning the land on a property in Corrowong. The company avoided a fine and criminal finding, and the company intends to have the decision reviewed. Angus Taylor said he has no direct or controlling interest in the company. Labor the Greens have called for Taylor to resign, citing meetings he sought with senior environment officials about the grasslands while the review was under way. He denies any wrongdoing. McKenzies sports grants submission fails to explain role PMs office Bridget McKenzie, who quit as sports minister while engulfed in the sports grants scandal, lodged a bulky response to a Senate inquiry that still failed to explain the role of Scott Morrisons office in rejigging sports funding on the day the last election was called. McKenzie insisted she was not aware of applications for funds being colour-coded according to the party representing the electorate. However, it is likely the former Nationals deputy leader will be directly questioned on matters by the committee next month. Leaked report shows government told to ban fracking in Lake Eyre basin The Guardian obtained a leaked report that revealed the Queensland government was urged by experts to ban fracking in the environmentally sensitive Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin. The government had blocked reports release after granting gas companies new exploration rights, infuriating conservation groups who called for the findings to be made public. Labor MPs quits, setting up Covid byelection Labor MP Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro, announced he would resign from parliament, citing health issues incurred while he was a serviceman. It sets up a federal byelection contest during the Covid-19 pandemic that could be expected to canvass the governments response to both the pandemic and the recent bushfires which ravaged the area, as well as other local issues. Labor is expected to preselect the mayor of Bega Valley shire, while the NSW deputy premier, Nationals leader John Barilaro, is considering whether to throw his hat in the ring.","700"
"2020-05-01T23:44:31Z","us-news","US news","California governor promises changes to lockdown as protests sweep state","Californias governor, Gavin Newsom, promised meaningful adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days as thousands of protesters gathered across the state in defiance of the lockdown. Demonstrations took place from the capital of Sacramento to San Francisco and San Diego, while large crowds turned out in Orange countys Huntington Beach, a recent flashpoint after Newsom ordered beaches there to close. Newsom said that the state was getting very close to making changes that would affect how businesses, including restaurants, could operate, and urged residents to be patient. He said the announcement of the changes would come in days, not weeks.   Related: Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters   Nearly 3,000 people protested in Huntington Beach on Friday, the citys police chief told the OC Register. The Huntington Beach protest followed the closure of beaches in Orange county after a weekend when tens of thousands of people hit the sands south of Los Angeles county, which had been closed for weeks. Newsom scolded local residents for defying the spirit of the stay-at-home order, and responded by ordering all beaches in the county to temporarily close.

Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images   I served in the army and fought tyrants and dictators overseas and this has gone too far, one protester told the Los Angeles Times. I didnt do that to come back here and live under a tyrant in my own country. Many of the Huntington Beach protesters brought their children along with them, the Los Angeles Times reported, with one protester saying he had come with his wife and three young children because it was important to show that the protesters are normal people. In Sacramento, the states capital, a packed crowd of protesters faced off with lines of riot cops in a tense and chaotic protest on Friday afternoon. Traitors! the protesters screamed at police, according to a livestream of the protest produced by reporters from the Sacramento Bee. Some protesters held signs promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies or questioning whether the coronavirus is real, while others protested the closure of businesses during the pandemic, arguing that all jobs are essential. Almost none of the protesters were wearing masks, according to reporters and photographers at the scene. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) had announced that it would be barring protests at the capitol because of a lack of social distancing by participants at a previous rally, but protesters gathered on the steps of the building regardless, chanting Whose house? Our house! The CHP repeatedly ordered the protesters to disperse, the Sacramento Bee reported, and by 3pm, a line of law enforcement in full riot gear had slowly pushed protesters back from the capitol steps towards the street.

Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images   Other protests were smaller: only about 150 people rallied in San Francisco, and hundreds in San Diego, according to local news reports. The rallies across California against Newsoms stay-at-home orders came as a rural county in northern California became the first to defy statewide orders by allowing nonessential businesses to reopen and diners to eat in restaurants. Modoc county, in the states far north-east, near Oregon, had no Covid-19 cases, a local official told the Associated Press. In his Friday news conference, Newsom said he empathized with the protesters frustration and concern and deeply understandable anxiety about the economy and the fate and future of their families, and said that the state was trying to work closely to respond to the concerns of more rural areas of the state. Were paying attention to you, Newsom said, speaking to the states rural residents. We recognize the economic pain. But the availability of testing for coronavirus had also lagged in rural areas, Newsom said later, highlighting the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. Asked about his response to protesters calling him a tyrant and a fascist, Newsom simply urged Californians to take care of yourself. Wear a face covering, he said. Do justice to physical distancing. You dont want to contract this disease. People who showed no symptoms could still spread the virus, Newsom warned the protesters. Protect yourself. Protect your family. Protect your kids, your parents.    Protesters from ReOpen California demonstrate outside the State Capitol in Sacramento. Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA   The governor passed on responsibility to local law enforcement officials for dealing with the fraught question of whether protesters who were violating social distancing guidelines should be arrested. He said he could not possibly monitor and respond to every protest happening across the state. I have confidence in local law enforcement, incredible confidence, Newsom said. In Sacramento, where many protesters were flouting social distancing guidelines, at least one person had been arrested, according to the Sacramento Bee. Newsom defended his announcement that changes in shelter-in-place would come in many days, rather than weeks, and said that the move was motivated by the data, not just by the political resistance bubbling up across the state. More than 2,000 people have died of coronavirus in California so far, including 91 people in the previous day, but the number of patients in intensive care units stayed flat, and the total number of hospitalizations had fallen slightly, both signs of progress justifying a move towards some changes in the emergency order, Newsom said. But, We can screw all that up and set all that back by making bad decisions, Newsom said, adding that these positive signed are only possible because people have done an incredible job in their physical distancing, he said. Thousands of people congregating together, not practicing social distancing or physical distancing, could undermine the current progress in preventing the spread of the virus, the governor said. If we can avoid that, we can get to the other side with modifications a lot quicker. Agencies contributed reporting","924"
"2020-05-01T23:37:26Z","world","World news","Remdesivir: US allows emergency use of experimental drug for coronavirus","US regulators have allowed the emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir, which appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster.
It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide.
Donald Trump announced the news on Friday at the White House alongside Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, who said the drug would be available for patients hospitalized with Covid-19.

 Related: Remdesivir: the antiviral drug is being touted as a possible coronavirus treatment  but will it work? 

The president said the approval represented a very promising situation in the countrys fight against coronavirus, and Dr Deborah Birx added, I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.
The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the governments top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial.
The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery, Fauci said earlier this week. What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.
The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that Gilead Sciencess remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized Covid-19 patients.
The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivirs effects could be rigorously evaluated.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. The drug also might be reducing deaths, although thats not certain from the partial results revealed so far.
Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill Covid-19 patients like those in this study. The drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital.







The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed experimental drugs, tests and other medical products to patients during public health crises.
In normal times the FDA requires substantial evidence of a drugs safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards, simply requiring that an experimental drugs potential benefits outweigh its risks.
No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval. The FDA can convert the drugs status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivirs safety and effectiveness.
Use of the drug will be authorized for adults or children who are hospitalized with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 and whose condition is severe, meaning they have low blood oxygen levels, need oxygen therapy or are on a mechanical ventilator, the FDA said.
Based on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drugs use, the FDA said in its statement.
The emergency use authorization (EUA) also includes information about possible side effects, which include increased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of inflammation or damage to cells in the liver; and infusion-related reactions, which may include low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, sweating and shivering. It also notes that there may be other serious side effects that have not been discovered yet.
The EUA requires hospitals to monitor patients liver enzymes through blood tests before the treatment is started and every day that treatment is ongoing.
Patients who receive the drug will be provided with a fact sheet, which is available here. The drug is administered through an IV once a day for up to 10 days.
Hahn said the drugs approval for emergency use represented an important clinical advance in the fight against coronavirus.
Daniel ODay, the Gilead CEO, said Friday that his company has already ramped up production of the drug and hopes to make millions of treatment courses available by the end of the year.
I think its important to note that this is a medicine for the most severe patients, ODay told the Today show. What we see here is really, of course, not a cure but a very, very significant and important treatment for patients.

"2020-05-01T23:32:05Z","world","World news","Will coronavirus spell an end to the great Chinese buffet?","It is hard to imagine the body-blow of the dining table revolution, which the Chinese government is now encouraging as a means to hold down Covid-19 infection rates by reducing general physical contact. Designated serving spoons, no double-dipping, even individual portions rather than family-size sharing platters, have all been floated as part of a new need for safety. When you think of the banquet style of a classic Chinese meal, a table heaving with dishes so varied and communal that you need the table to spin if you want to get round it, the lonely portions of the solitary eater are going to seem like quite a comedown. European cuisine may also struggle to adjust. The convention of individual portions, known as the Russian service, came to prominence in the 1810s in mainland Europe (though much later in Britain) and was basically a way to prove how rich you were (because you could afford the servants  it is much more labour-intensive to bring dishes out one person at a time). The French service that came before it, tables laden with sharing plates, was effortlessly blown away by the emotional appeal of ostentation.   Related: For the chop: 'dining table revolution' takes aim at food sharing in China   This century, though, the huge platter has come back to prominence. Spanish tapas took off and spread its conventions (lots of tiny, shared plates) across many different cuisines. Italian cuisine has its bursting, shareable antipasto tradition. There was a period when it became incredibly dclass to order anything just for yourself. And thats before you even start to think about the all-inclusive buffet, beloved of cruises and weddings, where it is far cheaper and easier to feed large numbers of people with large sharing dishes than individually. Meanwhile, the rise of the gastropub over the past three decades has forced the realisation that formality  far from being the whole point of dinner  makes most of us feel awkward. Steadily, food tended towards a more familytable style, large shared dishes where you served yourself. Its not quite so much of a hygiene faux pas as tapas, so long as you use the designated spoon, but it doesnt feel quite as safe as having your own plate and sticking to it. In short: weve all got quite a handbrake turn to perform, with the obvious rider that this is the least of our problems.","384"
"2020-05-01T23:30:45Z","australia-news","Australia news","'Why is it spreading?': fears for Newmarch House, the aged care home at the centre of Australia's Covid-19 crisis","Early on Thursday morning Mark Fahey received a call that hit him right between the eyes.
His mother, 76-year-old Ann Fahey, had been found collapsed on the floor of her room at the Newmarch House aged-care home in Penrith, in Sydneys west, where she is a resident.
Nurses feared shed fallen out of bed, but when he spoke to her on the phone Ann told Fahey that after waking during the night shed felt tired and dizzy and had laid down on the floor.
She had a 38.9 degree temperature so she was a bit off with the fairies, but all she kept saying was that she was tired, he told the Guardian. She just wanted to get off the phone and sleep.

By early afternoon staff confirmed what hed feared: more than a month after the aged-care home went into lockdown and after two previous tests came back negative, his mother was one of three new confirmed cases of Covid-19 recorded at Newmarch.
I dont understand. She was a model patient, did everything right, shes shut herself in her room the entire time, Fahey said.
Theres shitloads going through my mind. Why is it still happening?  How can they still be getting new cases after this long. I mean its not rocket science. Its coming in from the outside because shes been meticulous following all their guidelines.
The Covid-19 outbreak at Newmarch House, which has so far claimed the lives of 13 residents and threatens to overtake the Ruby Princess as Australias deadliest wave of the virus, began when a part-time carer worked six shifts while symptomatic and infectious.
Newmarch had already been in a type of lockdown before then. On 18 March the national cabinet announced rules placing strict limitations on the number of visitors allowed inside aged-care homes. The rules meant visits were limited to two adult visitors at once a day inside a residents room.

But when the staff member returned a positive diagnosis for Covid-19 on 11 April after being told she had come into contact with a confirmed case, a flood of cases within the home were quickly discovered. On 12 April the first resident returned a positive result for the virus. Six days later a 93-year-old man became the first to die.
Despite efforts to isolate every resident and the federal governments introduction of surge workers from a private company, Aspen Medical, to help contain the outbreak, infections have risen steadily.
There are now 61 confirmed cases of Covid-19 related to Newmarch House, including 24 staff and 37 residents. On Wednesday a 74-year-old man became the 13th resident to die and on Saturday, two further staff members tested positive.
New South Wales health officials have said the staff member who first became infected had experienced only extremely mild symptoms before testing positive, and the states chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, told media the woman was mortified when she discovered she had the virus.
In any case, the spiralling death toll inside the aged care home has left the families of some residents furious with Newmarchs operator, Anglicare. Families have been gathering outside the facility to hold a vigil every afternoon, with some lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their relative through a window.

This week, a group of family members published an open letter to Anglicares chief executive, Grant Millard, saying communication from within the home had been far from satisfactory.
Phones went unanswered day after day. Calls were not returned. Details about our individual loved ones were not provided regularly, the letter read.
The residents were reporting that the care was inadequate and they were becoming distressed. Many of them were sick and frightened and did not have regular access to their family on the outside which increased their levels of anxiety as well as ours.


Its heartbreaking to think this is how shes going to end her days

Elizabeth Lane



Some family members say Anglicare has improved its communication. After the NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, held a press conference outside the home on Wednesday, Louise Payne, who has led much of the campaign to improve communication with families, said shed received a phone call from Millard and been able to have a window visit with her mother.
It was wonderful. It sounds such a little thing but I was absolutely elated because its been two weeks of hell not knowing how she is, she said.
There are no guarantees, but its looking like mum might be one of the ones to beat this. Shes nearly 90, so if she does its amazing. 
Others, however, are losing patience. Elizabeth Lane, from Windsor, in Sydneys west, takes comfort in knowing her mother, Rose Davies, 84, is still making life hard for the nurses in Newmarch.

Mums always been a very difficult individual, so when they say shes being a bit of a handful I think: Thank god, shes still OK. If they told me she was being nice and cooperative Id know something was wrong, she said.
Davies lives in the palliative wing of Newmarch, and suffers from dementia. She has not tested positive for Covid-19, but Lanes voice cracks as she talks about the toll more than a month without seeing her family is taking on her mother.
Its heartbreaking to think this is how shes going to end her days, she said.
I know this is horrible for everyone. People have already lost their family, but I cant help thinking we may have lost our parents too. By the time we get to speak to them again, theyre not going to know who we are. For dementia patients having no contact, no stimulation, it all exacerbates their decline.

Lane said that when the outbreak occurred, she naively trusted that Anglicare would manage to get on top of this. But as the weeks have passed, her patience with the lack of communication from the home has worn out. When the aged-care home provided mobile phones for residents, Lane said she discovered her mothers hadnt been set up for her. A number she had been calling in the nurses station for updates was abruptly disconnected with no warning.
Ive got six or seven numbers that I just call over and over until someone answers, she said.
She was finally able to see her mother through a window on Friday, but only after she contacted the federal minister for aged care, Richard Colbeck.
He called me and said hed sort it out for me, she said.
I dont blame the staff, this has been an absolute shitstorm, theres no better word for it. The whole world has had trouble dealing with it. But I just think there hasnt been a real emergency plan in place and everything feels really reactive, even now.


You only get one mum ... Its the worst place in Australia to be unfortunately, and I cant get her out

Mark Fahey



Matthew Fowler, whose father Lionel has so far tested negative to Covid-19 twice, says he has been frustrated at Anglicares management of the situation.
Its absolutely appalling that a worker who was sick was allowed to work six shifts there.
On Friday, he joined the daily vigil outside the home, and said he was glad to see Anglicare had placed a senior chaplain for gathering family for the first time.
It should have happened from the first day.
As federal and state governments coordinate local health districts and surge staffing assistance to Newmarch, health authorities are struggling to understand how the virus is still spreading inside the heavily controlled facility.
In a statement, Anglicare said the new infections had occurred despite us having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place.
These new cases may reflect historical transmissions and reflect the rigorous and ongoing testing at Newmarch House. We will be investigating further how this has occurred, the statement read.

On Friday, when unveiling a national code for aged-care facility visitation, Colbeck said the governments assistance to Newmarch meant it was effectively running a mini-hospital within the facility, but did not criticise Anglicare for its response to the situation.
There has been no limit on the resources made available to Newmarch in managing this, he said.
This is not a finger-pointing or a blame exercise, its a very, very unfortunate circumstance where somebody who was asymptomatic, but obviously had a very high viral load, was in contact with people for six days, residents and staff, and this is the very, very tragic outcome of that.

On Saturday, Chant announced a further infection control review of Newmarch launched after a wave of infections this week had shown breaches of safety protocol amongst particularly the staff.
And thats obviously a concern. There have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not occurred, Chant said.
For the family of some residents, the situation is become increasingly desperate.

The schedule, drawn up by members of the Flat Pattern Committee, would see the Greenham Stakes and Craven Stakes, two major trials for the 2,000 Guineas, taking place on different days over the weekend of 23-24 May. The Nell Gwyn Stakes and Fred Darling Stakes, trials for the 1,000 Guineas, would be staged the same weekend, along with five more Group Three events including the Brigadier Gerard Stakes and the Sagaro Stakes, a trial for the Ascot Gold Cup.

The weekend of 30-31 May, meanwhile, would include the Lockinge Stakes, the first Group One of the season, along with the Group Two Yorkshire Cup, and the Dante Stakes, the most significant domestic trial for the Derby. The 2,000 Guineas and 1,000 Guineas would then be run on the weekend of 6-7 June, along with the Group One Coronation Cup, which would normally be part of that weekends Derby Festival at Epsom.
If the BHA is able to proceed with this best-case scenario, Royal Ascot would remain in its traditional position in mid-June, starting on 16 June, with the Derby and Oaks being staged in early July.
Sundays tips by Chris Cook
Those of us who are still learning about Hong Kong racing will be interested in the extent to which team tactics form a part of the action there, which should become clear in the running of Sunday mornings Queen Mother Memorial Cup. Tony Cruz will saddle the likely favourite, Helene Leadingstar (6.30), whose four opponents are all from the John Moore stable.
Helene Leadingstar (6.30) is the now horse, having finally got his first two wins in Hong Kong after a couple of years trying. This step up to a mile and a half must help a horse who won the South Australia Derby in 2018, when known as Leicester.
 Sunday mornings card will be shown live on Sky Sports Racing.

5.30 This Griffin race, featuring horses that had not competed before arriving in Hong Kong, has almost exactly the same cast as one that took place three weeks ago. Smiling Face was fancied that day but reared up in the stalls. Runner-up to a useful-looking rival, the horse has hardly anything in hand over Chancheng Prince or Sea Monarch on that showing but that loss of composure may have cost him. If he behaves better on this second outing, he can justify the faith shown by punters that day.
6.00 Demons Rock seems likely to be a short price for a horse that hasnt won since he was a two-year-old entire with Tom Dascombe in the summer of 2017. A compelling case is hard to make for any of these but Fairy Floss could be worth chancing, since his only previous start on dirt was also the closest he has come to success. 
7.00 It has taken time but Fabulous Eight now looks like making good on the promise he showed in late 2018. His third place last month was easily his best effort since then and he can be marked up a bit, having twice met trouble in running. From an in-form stable and with Joo Moreira aboard, he is sure to be a warm order.
7.30 Others have more obvious claims but there was a lot to like about Mig Energys fifth place at Happy Valley just over a fortnight ago. He wasnt beaten far that day after chasing too hot a pace, while the pair who forced it finished out the back. Hopefully a wide draw means he will avoid getting drawn into an early pace battle and, if so, he has the talent to get involved.
8.00 The tactically versatile Excel Delight is perhaps best suited by creeping into contention, which was how he scored here in February. He nearly pulled off the same trick a fortnight ago when beaten by inches by a classy young rival and will be unlucky to find something of similar talent in this field. 
8.35 This drop in class is interesting for Monster Kaka, who has dropped 20lb since starting in Hong Kong a year ago and now looks well treated and ready to win. He was a major eye-catcher when storming into third place a fortnight ago and the extra furlong should help. The lightly raced Snow Airjet may also be worth a second look.
9.05 Rather like his days with James Fanshawe, Enzemble has taken time to put it all together in Hong Kong but he won with a degree of authority when last seen. This belated return to 10 furlongs must be a help to him and he can see off Defining Moment, who has been helped by the visor but now makes a step up in class.
9.35 Party Genius is an obvious chance, but hell be a short price and is drawn wide again. Spicy Grill should be available at much bigger odds but is also going the right way and was beaten less than four lengths three weeks ago, after traffic problems. That was easily the best of his four runs and his first attempt at this trip. He should have more to offer.
10.10 Some interest in Good For You seems likely but Elite Patch appeals most, having won a couple of times in this grade in early winter before a step up in class made life tougher. 
10.45 The cheekpieces have helped Everyones Joy, who gradually worked his way into form before running down a hot favourite here last month. Chad Schofield keeps the ride and they set the standard, with a handy inside draw.

"2020-05-01T23:00:06Z","film","Film","Streaming: 1917 and the best first world war films online","With more than 45m in the bank, 1917 is the years highest-grossing film in UK cinemas by a country mile, and as things stand, nothings breaking that record for the foreseeable future. If Sam Mendess big, punchy first world war epic was still on your to-see list when cinemas succumbed to lockdown in March, its digital release on Monday will come as a welcome quarantine care package. You will have missed an opportunity, though. Justly rewarded at the Oscars for Roger Deakinss propulsive, sleight-of-hand cinematography and its layered, pummelling sound design, 1917 remains involving and impressive in any format, but had more immediate sensory grandeur on the big screen. Setting aside the commotion over its smartly executed illusion of being shot in two long takes, Mendess film is a man-on-a-mission tale in a simple, even classical vein, thinly characterised in ways that somewhat curtail its emotional impact. The technical showmanship here isnt mere window-dressing. Its what makes the film distinguished and immersive in the canon of films about the first world war  which rarely gets such elaborate cinematic treatment, at least relative to the ongoing parade of pyrotechnically enhanced second world war spectaculars. Perhaps its the knowledge of all that deathly bravado to come, however, that gives an additional sense of piercing tragedy to the greatest first world war films  many of which are available to stream, if you feel like situating Mendess blockbuster in context. Lewis Milestones All Quiet on the Western Front (BFI Player) is, astonishingly, 90 years old this year, and hasnt dated a whit, neither in its strikingly crisp, clean, unadorned film-making, nor in its tough, unsentimental perspective.    All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive   It remains pretty much the master template for any anti-war film, its non-partisan depiction of daily life for German soldiers in the trenches as vividly harrowing in its way as Mendess missive from the opposite side. That it deservedly won the best picture Oscar in 1930 is all the more remarkable when you consider that the same award went the year before to Wings (Amazon), a sweeping, silent action romance that seems largely enamoured of its WWI airman derring-do until its slightly ungainly war kills coda. Its smashing, old-school entertainment, but hasnt aged nearly as gracefully. See also Howard Hughess ludicrously glamorous planes-and-dames spectacle Hells Angels (1930), available on the Internet Archive. Its not much of a history lesson, but its a glistening romp. More stately decorum returned in A Farewell to Arms (Amazon Prime), a handsome, stirring 1932 adaptation of the Hemingway novel that accrues a genuine lump-in-throat gravity to its doomed romance between Gary Coopers dashing ambulance officer and Helen Hayess Red Cross nurse. Still, Hollywood depictions of the war veered ever more toward grandstanding and patriotism: see Howard Hawkss flawed but fascinating Sergeant York (Chili), a war-hero biopic caught between its subjects anti-war principles and conservative cheerleading that spoke very much to the moment in 1941. It would take the French to bring some cynicism to proceedings: Jean Renoirs peerless La Grande Illusion (1937), currently streaming on Mubi, still cuts deep with its humane, complex comedy, astutely threading class solidarity through opposing factions in its prisoner-of-war escape saga. After that, it wasnt until Stanley Kubricks still-breathtaking Paths of Glory (1957; iTunes) that the Great War got a cast-iron classic film, with a portrayal of trench warfare as unflinching as its thorny examination of the moral consequences. In 1981, Gallipoli, Peter Weirs majestic, sun-scorched study (Amazon Prime) of Australian soldiers swallowed whole in the eponymous allied war campaign, brought a fresh national perspective to a genre dominated by American and European points of view.   Watch a trailer for Testament of Youth.  Recent decades have brought fewer essential first world war dramas, unless you count Steven Spielbergs claggy, custardy War Horse adaptation (2011), or a serviceable but standard-issue 2017 remake of that old chestnut Journeys End. Over both of those  indeed, over 1917  its James Kents exquisite, underrated 2014 Vera Brittain biopic Testament of Youth (Amazon Prime) that I return to. A rare, bracing treasure for its foregrounding of female perspective in a tale of war, it has the soaring swirl and plunging sadness of the very best. More titles new to streaming this week    Matthew McConaughey in The Beach Bum (2019). Photograph: Allstar/Vice Films   The Beach Bum (Blue Finch, 18) Harmony Korines first all-out stoner comedy never found a Spring Breakers-level following, but its mellow and enveloping if youre in the mood, so to speak. If youre not, at least the ice-cream tones of Benot Debies cinematography make it a beautiful indulgence. Richard Jewell (Warner Bros, 15) The businesslike nature of Clint Eastwoods recent films works to the benefit of this gripping, dourly ambiguous biopic of the security guard caught up in the Atlanta Olympic Park bombing. The script wobbles, particularly on its gender politics, but Paul Walter Hauser and Kathy Bates are superb. Water Lilies (Mubi, 15) With Portrait of a Lady on Fire having woken up a wider audience to Cline Sciammas brilliance, the time is right for Mubi to stream her shimmering 2007 debut  long unavailable in any format  which demonstrated her sensual command of the female gaze early on. The Family Way (StudioCanal, 12) This re-release of the 1966 Britcom about newlyweds trapped under the same roof as the grooms family certainly makes for timely quarantine viewing. The film itself is a charming time capsule, no longer edgy but gently wry, buoyed by Paul McCartneys score.","887"
"2020-05-01T22:57:52Z","world","World news","Coronavirus 1 May: at a glance","Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Kim Jong-un reportedly appears in public The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un makes his first public appearance in nearly three weeks, according to South Koreas Yonhap news agency. His absence amid the pandemic led to speculation, though South Korean and US officials have stressed their belief he was not ill and could simply have been sheltering from the outbreak. Global number of infections passes 3.3m At least 3,334,416 people have been infected and at least 237,943 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes. Trump now hopes for fewer than 100,000 US deaths The president offers an increasingly bleak picture, telling a White House event: Hopefully, were going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless. Trump, who initially dismissed the outbreak as a hoax, has oscillated between claiming that a death toll of between 100,000 and 200,000 people would represent a success and predicting it could be as low as 60,000 or 70,000. According to the latest figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 62,406 people have died in the US since the outbreak began. US to allow emergency use of drug for hospitalised patients The drug remdesivir is approved for emergency use to treat virus patients. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarifies that the drug has specifically been cleared for emergency use on those in hospital. Trump says the approval represents a very promising situation and the White Houses taskforce coordinator Dr Deborah Birx adds: I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time. Markets slide on US-China Covid-19 trade war threat Trumps threats to reignite the US-China trade war in reaction to the pandemic trigger a sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount. Against a backdrop of rising tension between the worlds two biggest economic superpowers, share prices resume a downward slide, with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London. Strict measures to continue in Ireland Restrictions on movement are to continue for several more weeks in Ireland, although over-70s may now leave their homes to exercise. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says most restrictions will remain until 18 May to weaken the virus further so it doesnt make a comeback. UK death toll rises to at least 27,510 The UK reports 739 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says 177,454 people have tested positive: an increase of 6,201 since Thursdays update. Of those, 15,111 patients are in hospital, Hancock says. India extends lockdown The country extends its lockdown  the worlds broadest by population  for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. The home ministry says that in view of significant gains in the Covid-19 situation, there will be considerable relaxations in areas with few or no cases. South Africa begins to ease lockdown Some industries are allowed to reopen after five weeks of restrictions in Africas most industrialised nation, which was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March.

Australia made the unprecedented announcement that its borders would close. Our plans to elope fell to pieces, like a virus touching soap. And our reasons for wanting to get married in the first place, much like international borders, hardened from something porous into solid concrete. We wanted the protection of marriage, fast. My partner and I were born 16,400km apart, in Newton, Massachusetts and Canberra, Australia respectively. This brings a frisson to our relationship  we spend hours swapping notes on the similarities and differences in our social milieus; we always have something to share that the other hasnt seen; a reason to travel and a reason to come home.   Related: 'The day was full of joy and love': how people are getting married while in lockdown   As the daughter of an unwed couple whove been together close to 40 years, Id always been sceptical about marriage. But being with someone from another country has a way of making it seem more like an administrative necessity. Its not quite a guarantee, but marriage is a magic piece of paper that makes it that much more likely youll get to spend the rest of your life with the person you love, regardless of where youre going, where youre from, or how quickly you have to get there. With the possibility of tragedy edging closer, we needed that magic. Between us weve lived in three countries and eight cities  there are people we love all over the world. Without an enormous expenditure of capital and carbon, we could never exchange vows without leaving somebody important out. If we eloped, at least everyone could feel equally angry at us. Meanwhile, the world seemed to flatten  when all your communication takes place on the phone or through a computer screen, it doesnt matter who lives up the road and who lives a 24-hour flight away. Early in the evening of 22 March I made a proposal. Micah looked at me as though I was crazy. Then we hit the same wavelength, he called me a genius and pecked me on the lips. Covid-19 had already robbed the world of thousands of lives, jobs and freedoms  but could it give us our dream wedding? No complex travel arrangements, no savings drained. When most peoples realities have been completely upended, getting married on the internet just didnt seem that weird any more. We could skip the most painful gut churn of wedding planning  weighing up our love for our friends against the cost of feeding them  and invite anyone who wanted to come. We just had to act fast.   Related: 'Lockdown is a great test': the New York couples getting married on Zoom   On 25 March we met our celebrant in a park  a blue-eyed ninja she called herself, in a black mask and blue rubber  gloves, and within five minutes, standing metres apart, we signed our notice of intended marriage. In Australia you have to fill in this paperwork at least 30 days before your ceremony. We gave ourselves 31  hoping for the best, but preparing to cancel at any moment. As soon as the ink dried, it began. With government regulations setting a maximum of five people at weddings we were allowed two more people to join us in person as witnesses to this mad act of hope  I called my event planner friend, a set designer and human Swiss army knife Joshua, who would be tasked with turning our kitchen into something resembling an altar.    Alyx and Micah on the night of their engagement Photograph: Alyx Gorman   Then we approached Charles, another close friend and videographer, whod been contemplating setting up a livestreaming business. We wanted to be his first clients. Although Id never imagined having one myself, Ive always loved weddings. I love the dressing up and sense of occasion. But most of all, I love the chance to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. I love their sense of social possibility. I love the embarrassing stories. I wanted, more than anything, for our guests to have that feeling and I was confident I could find the perfect digital venue. Turns out, I was overconfident. Anyone whos ever heard a feedback-induced portal to hell open on Zoom is probably aware that, although it is 2020, video conferencing technology never works how it should. Every night for the next week, I experimented with platforms. There was the one that crashed constantly and looked like science fiction from the 70s. There was the one that could ruin the entire ceremony if a single guest failed to hit mute. The one that cost hundreds of dollars and could only be purchased with an annual subscription  that we would be using a grand total of once. The best option was brand new. It launched around the same time Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. Designed for conferences and expos, the platform is called HopIn. It would allow for a centre stage for the ceremony. It would allow for different groups to sit at different tables, it would let guests send each other private messages; set up their own video chats and even bump into each other, in a function similar to that late-2000s forest of flashing  Chat Roulette. It looked perfect.  So, as Australias curve began to flatten; and Americas began its terrifying ascent, our plans snowballed. Wedding planning became our answer to iso-baking.   We sent the last invitation to our wedding  via Instagram DM  just seven minutes before the ceremony started   Micah learned how to dye my hair, and retouched my roots using a YouTube tutorial. Emily, a makeup artist, spent two hours teaching me how to paint a heavy face over Houseparty. Emma, a stylist, found me shoes and a pearl headdress online with lightning speed. Alex arranged a Zoom bucks and hens night, complete with an embarrassing PowerPoint presentation and a hangover that was anything but virtual. Nadine, whod been on Micah and my first date, agreed to do a reading. A generous handful of friends, despite the pressures of being parents in confinement, managed to film gorgeous videos of their kids holding foliage so we could have flower children at our ceremony. Micahs cousin in Chicago, a rabbi, agreed to give us a blessing. My closest friend, locked down in Paris and recovering from coronavirus, sewed a tuxedo for her dogs favourite toy and turned her puppy into our ring bearer. But the biggest help came from our families. My 90-year-old grandmother, obeying stay-at-home orders in Sydney, agreed to wrap her head around a new piece of technology in order to give a speech live. Its like youre making an episode of Married at First Sight, she said on the phone, dryly one day, as I ran her through our to-do list. My mother found me the perfect wedding dress  the nightgown her late mother had worn on the night of her own wedding ceremony in 1952. Using measurements Id emailed her, she hand-tailored it to fit me. Since our aisle would be the hallway from our bedroom to our kitchen, getting married in pyjamas felt entirely appropriate. Before the ceremony had even started, more than 40 people from all over the world had helped us make it happen. Lying in bed at night, Micah and I quietly wondered again and again whether wed made the right decision. The thought of doing something so intimate and optimistic, in front of so many people, when the world was in such turmoil, made us both feel anxious. But then our inbox would ping from an invitee telling us how excited they were to be included, and our nerves would settle.    The home wedding altar. Photograph: Anna Turner   On the day of our wedding, I was running late. My friend had arranged a bridal prep breakfast, complete with pink champagne and some of the people closest to me. My hands were trembling as I did my makeup. I glued my eyelids together trying to insert false lashes. I screamed and swore, and ran through our final rehearsal with blurry vision. I left my phone on the floor and showed my bridal party my underpants as I stepped over it in a panic. But seeing their faces on screen together  from Sydney, Canberra, New York, London and Paris, but all right there with me  brought on a wave of calm.   Related: Dating during the coronavirus lockdown   We sent the last invitation to our wedding  via Instagram DM  just seven minutes before the ceremony started. And somehow, despite all the technical hurdles and physical barriers, miraculously removed by two tech support angels who offered to help even though they didnt know us, it all worked out. To be a bride is to be on display, but it was still confronting to see myself as our guests saw me, in a tiny screen, weeping. As our celebrant mentioned the horror of the world around us in this moment, I locked eyes with Joshua. Coronavirus had taken someone close to him but still he was prepared to be there for us on this day; making lemonade out of bitter fruit. After the ceremony and speeches, we socialised with guests. I cheered when two of our friends  whose own vows had been delayed by the virus  stood up wearing full tuxedos on top with underpants and socks on the bottom. As we answered questions, our guests were talking to each other. My boss met my parents. People ran into exes, they offended each other with off-colour jokes. They saw old friends for the first time in years and made new connections.    A socially distanced bouquet toss. Photograph: Anna Turner   When the event concluded, we wandered the neighbourhood for photographs. On the street, the few cars that passed honked. A friend down the road walked by for a moment to catch my bouquet. Our inbox filled with pictures of our 400 or so guests; with messages of love, and gossip from the event. I crackled with nerves from the magnitude of it all, and clung close to my new husband. We ate cake, delivered by yet another friend, and kissed on the floor of our ersatz chapel. We revelled in our ability to be with each other that night, in a way that would not have been possible if our guests had been there too. At one point, I lay on the bathroom floor in silence, encoding the magnitude of what wed entered into. I could never have handled being a bride in real life. But wed managed to skip past all the parts of a wedding that made us most stressed, and keep the parts that mattered to us. If only we could have hugged our guests afterwards. On our first day as husband and wife, we lay in bed watching movies. We read the chatlog from our event and laughed at the highlights. No one asked us when we would have a real wedding. Beaming into the homes of everyone we love, from the home we built together, it felt about as real as it gets.","1773"
"2020-05-01T21:32:32Z","us-news","US news","Trump 'cannot tell a lie' – but can Kayleigh McEnany, his new press secretary?","Channeling George Washington, Donald Trump, who has reportedly made 18,000 false or misleading claims in 1,170 days, recently proclaimed: I cannot tell a lie.   Related: Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade   The presidents ministry of untruth has produced some whoppers over the years. Kellyanne Conway gained immortality with alternative facts. Sean Spicer used his first briefing as White House press secretary to inflate the size of Trumps inauguration crowd. His successor, Sarah Sanders, admitted to lying to reporters about the firing of the FBI director James Comey. The press secretary Stephanie Grisham never lied from the White House podium  because she never held a press briefing. So when the latest incumbent, Kayleigh McEnany, on Friday held the first such briefing in 417 days, the Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin had a question: Will you pledge to never lie to us from that podium? Without missing a beat, McEnany replied: I will never lie to you. You have my word on that. Expect to hear replays of that line before this presidency is done. Even on what proved an assured debut, McEnany skated close to peddling dodgy information about Trumps responses to the coronavirus pandemic (This president has always sided on the side of data) and to allegations of sexual misconduct (He has always told the truth). But the good news for the White House is that McEnany, 32, benefits by comparison with the desperately low standards of both her boss and her predecessors. Over the past month Trump has been a verbal cannon of insults, mendacity, miracle cures, self-aggrandisement and self-pity, culminating in a proposal about bleach injection to fight Covid-19 that caused him to be metaphorically led away by men in white coats.   Of course, everyone should watch the Fox News town hall with the president  Itll be cant-miss television  Kayleigh McEnany    Spicer, who turned up at his first briefing in an oversized jacket and a foul mood, often resembled a rabbit caught in headlights, sealing his fate by claiming Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons. Sanders was an aggressive propagandist on her bosss behalf. Grisham was missing in action. But McEnany, a devout Christian dressed in black and wearing a cross around her neck, who set down a binder of notes on a lectern that last year literally gathered dust, has plenty of TV experience and is a more polished performer than any of them. Set against Trumps word salads, she sounded like a model of concision. Set against his temperament, she was the calm after the storm. She described Trump as the most accessible president in history and insisted his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who recently called the administrations response to a pandemic which has killed 63,000 Americans a success story, has done a great job. She echoed Trumps accusation that the World Health Organization praised Chinas leadership on the 22nd and 23rd of January, without mentioning that on 22 January Trump tweeted Terrific working with President Xi and on 24 January wrote: China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. Thankfully for McEnany, reporters were too polite to point out her own remark on 25 February: We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here. On the contrast between sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden and Brett Kavanaugh, she called the latter a grave miscarriage of justice so forcefully one might have assumed Kavanaugh had been destroyed, rather than now sitting on the supreme court. McEnany also went on the offensive over the FBIs handling of the case against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, suggesting it should should scare every American and parroting Trumps refrain of Russia, Russia, Russia. When Jon Karl of ABC News asked about it, she tried to turn the tables: Does it trouble you that the FBI said, Weve gotta get Flynn to lie? Doesnt that trouble you as a journalist and, not only that, as an American citizen? Karl replied dryly: Well, its certainly something worth reporting. Its not my job to say whether or not its troubling. McEnany arched her left eyebrow at that. She also proved adept on the most important aspects of any press secretarys job: the art of saying nothing. There were plenty of I dont want to get ahead of the president deflections. As for policy depth, which is what the briefings are meant be about, that remains to be seen. Kurt Bardella, a political commentator, tweeted: Objectively @kayleighmcenany is doing the best job (so far) at the podium for @realDonaldTrump than anyone else who has served as @PressSec ... her experience on cable news makes her a far more seasoned spokesperson than her predecessors.   Related: Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters   From the Trump teams point of view, Bardella added, she is poised, capable, on-message, in-command, prepares and a very effective communicator. Mark Meadows, the new White House chief of staff who has shaken up the communications operation, will probably be pleased. But it was McEnanys sign-off that was perhaps the most revealing insight into what she called her mission to bring you the mindset of the president. She declared: Of course, everyone should watch the Fox News town hall with the president from 7pm to 9pm [on Sunday]. Itll be cant-miss television  much like the highly rated President Trump coronavirus task force briefings have been. If Trumps attention span stretched to the end of the half-hour briefing, he will have been happy with that.","886"

It was effectively a public debut for Kayleigh McEnany, whose immediate predecessor, Stephanie Grisham, never delivered a briefing in nine months in the role.   Related: Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade   Recently, Trump has turned daily coronavirus task force briefings into multi-hour back-and-forths with the press. Taking the lectern for the first time, McEnany stressed that she would be speaking on behalf of the president and the highest-ranking officials in his administration. Im around the president almost the entire day, she said. I was just with him before I left to come out and speak with you guys. I think my staff can attest to the fact that they have a very hard time finding me because Im normally with the president in the Oval Office. So Im consistently with him, absorbing his thinking, and its my mission to bring you the mindset of the president, deliver those facts so this president gets fair and accurate reporting and the American people get fair and accurate information. McEnany was less outwardly combative than Trump. She did not accuse White House reporters of being or peddling fake news. Nor did she say any outlet had terrible ratings. Still, she repeated Trumps main arguments. Regarding the World Health Organization and its role in battling the coronavirus outbreak, for example, she said: The WHO appears to clearly have a China bias. I mean, you look at this timeline and its really damning for the WHO when you consider the fact that on 31 December you had Taiwanese officials warning about human-to-human transmission, the WHO did not make that public. On 9 January, the WHO repeated Chinas claim that the virus does not transmit readily between people, that was quite apparently false. On 14 January, the WHO again repeated Chinas talking points about no human-to-human transmission. Under fire for his own administrations response to Covid-19, which as of Friday afternoon had infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more than 63,000, Trump has accused the WHO of slow-walking moves that could have prevented global spread. Earlier in April, he announced that his administration would halt funding to the organization, pending a review. McEnanys first briefing also landed on the day that Trumps all-but-certain general election opponent, the former vice-president Joe Biden, publicly responded to an allegation of sexual assault by a former Senate staffer. McEnany was asked about comments made by the president in an interview with a conservative radio host, that the allegation against Biden by Tara Reade was more credible than those made against the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford or against Trump by numerous women. McEnany framed the accusations as old news that had been cleared up by Trumps victory in the 2016 election. He has always told the truth on these issues, she claimed. Hes denied them immediately and youre bringing up issues  from four years ago that were asked and answered and the American people had their say in the matter when they elected President Trump as president of the United States. Leave it to the media to really take an issue about the former vice-president [Biden] and turn it on the president and bring up accusations from four years ago that were asked and answered in the form of the vote of the American people. McEnany also discussed Michael Flynn, the first of Trumps four national security advisers who resigned after a brief spell in the role and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The president has indicated a potential pardon for Flynn, who has not yet been sentenced. On the subject of recently unsealed investigative documents, McEnany was asked why she called the FBI investigation of Flynn a miscarriage of justice, given his guilty plea. Reporters, she answered, should more aggressively cover how the FBI handled the investigation. Again, the press secretary  who earlier promised never to lie to reporters  sounded some of the same notes, in a the same tone, as Trump. Do you not consider it a miscarriage of justice when you have the FBI writing We want to get someone to lie? McEnany said. The answers yes and I encourage the media to cover it, because Ive watched a lot of your networks Ive read a lot of your papers. Ive seen a whole lot of scant information about Michael Flynn, when there was a whole lot of speculation about Russia, Russia, Russia, culminating in $40m of taxpayer money being lost, and the complete and total exoneration of President Trump.   Related: Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters   Most observers do not consider the special counsel Robert Mueller to have exonerated Trump in his investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. Indeed, though he did not establish a criminal conspiracy or recommend charges of obstruction of justice, Mueller said he was not clearing the president. Trump and his allies have regularly claimed exoneration regardless. It is unclear how often McEnany will appear in the White House briefing room. Trump press secretaries had their appearances scaled back after the president decided they were doing an inadequate job. As to the timing of the briefings, we do plan to do them, McEnany said. I will announce the timing of that forthcoming but we do plan to continue these. Her first appearance had lasted about half an hour, well short of Trumps marathon sessions.","911"

Billionaire John Malones Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media and a 10% stake in ITV, is understood to be in talks with Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica to combine their UK assets in a joint venture. The talks will raise speculation about whether Liberty may be open to including ITV in the deal, as the share price of the broadcaster of shows including Coronation Street and Love Island has hit a 10-year low amid the fall in ad revenues due to the coronavirus. In 2006, Virgin Medias then owner Sir Richard Branson saw the benefits of a takeover of ITV, but Sky took a stake in the free-to-air broadcaster to thwart the move. Malones Liberty Global is ITVs largest shareholder, making him the kingmaker in any potential deal for the broadcaster. A deal between Virgin Media and O2 would bring together the mobile operators 34m customers, the largest network in the UK, with the cable operators 5.3m broadband, pay-TV and mobile users. O2 has been a target for a potential takeover since 2015 when a 10.25bn bid by rival Three UK, which is owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, was blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds. Telefonica subsequently explored a potential 10bn spin-off of the business on the London stock market to reduce debt. The initial public offering was subsequently put on hold as the impact of Brexit raised fears over the state of the UK economy. A combination of Virgin Media, which runs virtual mobile network Virgin Mobile using BTs network, and O2 has previously been seen in the city as a smart consolidation move in the UK telecommunications industry. In November, Telefonica, which is due to announce first-quarter earnings on 7 May, announced a major global restructuring plan to focus on four main markets including the UK, while selling off a number of assets in Latin America. Last year, Liberty Global sold its German and Eastern European cable assets to Vodafone for 18bn. As a result the company has about 5.6bn in cash to deploy for potential investments. Liberty Global and Vodafone have previously held talks about a tie-up in the UK, similar to the current talks between Virgin Media and O2, but they did not progress to a deal. However, the two companies struck a joint venture deal in the Netherlands in 2016, combining cable and mobile networks, and a revival of talks in the UK cannot be ruled out now a potential deal with O2 has been made public. Last year, Vodafone and Virgin Media signed a deal in the UK to use each others networks, which was viewed as a renewing of closer ties that could kick on to potential talks of a wider deal. Liberty Global, Virgin Media, O2 and Telefonica declined to comment. ","489"

Halima Aden filmed herself catwalking on her balcony. Joan Smalls posed in her sun-drenched back yard in Puerto Rico. Karlie Kloss, Ashley Graham and Alessandra Ambrsio also took part.

Photograph: Handout   The choreographer Stephen Galloway instructed them remotely on their walks. The music was important. We sent them music beforehand to give good energy to walk  the energy is amazing, said Roitfeld. The results, she added, were quite beautiful. These models know how to do their make-up and hair better than you or I. Models wore clothes from their own wardrobes. I couldnt send anything to them, Roitfeld explained. Which was a challenge for me, a control freak. But we just said: Wear something that makes you feel good. If you want to be evening, be evening, or you can be in your joggings. The fashion industry has been upended by the Covid-19 crisis, with the crew of photo shoots and catwalk shoots particularly impacted, often unable to work remotely. Fashion shows, with their huge backstage teams and audiences of hundreds sitting shoulder to shoulder, look unlikely to return for many months. The event was conceived to replace a real-life CR Runway fashion show. Unfortunately so many cannot work, and its going to be a big problem, Roitfeld said. But the show must go on and even if its tough we have to do something. Everyone is going to have to become creative. We are going to have better times but it will never be like before. It will be a totally different world, not just for fashion but in general.    Kim Kardashian West making a video-link appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in late March.

Kim Kardashian West was among those popping up, as well as designers including Off-Whites Virgil Abloh, Diane von Frstenberg and Alexander Wang. Not only is the fashion industry struggling logistically and economically, but it is also recalibrating tonally as recession looms. This event, said Roitfeld, might make fashion more approachable, because not all of the girls are living in some huge villa in Beverley Hills, some of them dont have big apartments. It makes them more approachable. Its more human in a way.","598"

It marks the point when weather is supposed to improve, and is also called Ctshamhain, or first of summer. Beltane was a traditional Celtic festival celebrated in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, with similar events in Germany and Sweden. The name Beltane probably means blazing fire, and the night was marked by the lighting of bonfires to symbolically invoke the growing power of the sun. Dancers would caper around or jump over fires, and cattle were driven around or between fires before being herded to their summer pastures. All the hearths in the community would be extinguished and relit with brands from the Beltane fire. The flames were supposed to have a cleansing effect, the renewed solar light driving out the accumulated bad spirits and pestilence of the long winter. Beltane traditions continued well into the 19th century, despite opposition from the church which attempted to rebrand the event as Walpurgis Night, or Saint Walpurgas Eve, after the saint responsible for protection against plagues. Beltane has been revived in the modern era as a cultural festival. The celebrations may be low-key this year, but the disinfecting power of the returning sun has rarely been more welcome.  ","212"

Its going to leave. Its going to be gone, Donald Trump pronounced of coronavirus on Wednesday. The words were eerily similar to the presidents prediction in late February that Its going to disappear  a theme he harped on repeatedly as the caseload and fatalities rose. Since that forecast, a million Americans have fallen ill with coronavirus  almost a third of the global total  and more than 60,000 have died, in just a few weeks surpassing the US death toll in all the years of the Vietnam war. This week, it was reported that almost 70 people had died at a single veterans nursing home in Massachusetts. New York is struggling to bury its dead. This is what the presidents son-in-law, Jared Kushner, describes as a great success story. This is the context in which the administration is letting its physical distancing guidelines lapse, instead advising much less stringent measures. Mr Kushner suggests that by July the country could be really rocking again. But Americans will suffer from Mr Trumps keenness to get back to business, as if the pre-coronavirus state of affairs were still possible. Medical experts have already warned about the risks of another surge in cases. The question is whether states, cities, institutions and individuals can again mitigate the harm he is wreaking upon his country. Some may; others are leading his charge: in Georgia, such essential services as tattoo parlours and bowling alleys are once again plying their trade. Texas is allowing shops, cinemas, shopping malls and restaurants to reopen, albeit with restrictions on capacity. Without significant testing and tracing, it is evident where such decisions will lead. The best that can be said for Mr Trumps election-driven wishful thinking is that it is less immediately dangerous than his recent public musings that people might have injections of disinfectant as a cure. Each week of the pandemic has brought new shame upon the president: he failed to equip his country and its health workers, to advocate physical distancing when it was desperately needed, or even to look like he was seriously concerned about the outbreak and its victims, preferring instead to boast about the ratings for his briefings. While leaders around the world enjoyed a surge in support as the pandemic took hold  the rally-around-the-flag effect  Mr Trumps appalling performance has finally taken a toll on his popularity. He had counted on a strong economy to see him back into office in November. But with more than 30 million US workers filing unemployment claims in the last six weeks  and economists suggesting that the real level of job losses could be far worse  his confidence has been shaken. This week it was reported that he had lashed out at his own campaign after polls showed him trailing Joe Biden in crucial states and with older voters. With the Democrat facing a sexual assault claim and running a virtual campaign while Mr Trump commands daily airtime, it is clear that the president is doing the damage himself. He is seeking to shift the blame for the pandemic to the World Health Organization (having ignored its repeated warnings) and to China. On Thursday he contradicted his own director of national intelligence by claiming that he had seen evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory; Trump officials have reportedly leaned on the agencies to find evidence to back the theory. This conduct too is unpleasantly familiar. His contempt for the truth; his determination to evade responsibility while holding the most powerful job in the world; his ignorance, his narcissism and the threat he poses to his country  all have become still more painfully evident through this crisis, but were clear before. Yet he has so far defied the laws of political gravity. Americans have paid dearly for Mr Trumps complacency, recklessness, irrationality and incompetence. But are they at last ready to make him pay?","660"
"2020-05-01T20:08:13Z","commentisfree","Opinion","The Guardian view on Normal People: young love never looked better","The makers of the new 12-part adaptation of Sally Rooneys 2018 novel Normal People have pulled off a remarkable feat. Avoiding all that is perfunctory about too many stage and screen versions of literary hits, they have crafted a work, available on iPlayer, that is set to become a television drama classic. Writing, casting, acting, direction: all are pin sharp. The risks of filming such sexually explicit material are triumphantly grasped. The novel and its author (who co-wrote the script) are Irish. In a British media landscape increasingly dominated by the US  with organisations from local papers to the BBC under threat while Netflix, Disney and Amazon reap the lockdowns rewards  Normal Peoples locations in Sligo, Dublin, Italy and Sweden are not the least of its pleasures. But the more extraordinary journey, particularly to viewers whose teenage years are long past, is through the actors to the unforgettable intensity of first love and lust. The intimate bond between Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal) is the storys subject and the depiction of their struggles to define themselves and each other, against familial and social backdrops that are shown to have penetrated their characters at the deepest levels, is sexy, romantic  and not soppy at all. Its widely if not universally acknowledged that young people are having a tough time. In the UK, the combination of tuition fees, the gig economy and housing costs meant many were struggling even before the coronavirus hit. But while Rooneys characters are insulated from these pressures (Marianne by wealth, Connell by intelligence), her sympathetic portrayal of the dilemmas of youth feels particularly apt in our divided times. Like the main character in Rooneys first book, Connell is a writer. He and Marianne vie to praise each others brains. But (as with Phoebe Waller-Bridges Fleabag) they show that cleverness can be a partner to confusion. Both on paper and screen, Rooney makes a case for fiction as a route to deeper understanding. The male gaze remains the default setting for visual culture, with womens bodies routinely objectified decades after feminists began protesting about this. Normal People can now be added to a too-short list of film and TV dramas that have a womans sexuality, complete with a troubling masochistic streak in Mariannes case, at the fore. But it is far from a didactic piece. Like Noah Baumbachs 2019 film Marriage Story, it is committed to seeing the heterosexual relationship it describes from both male and female points of view. With episodes that are mostly less than 30 minutes, the series can either be rationed or binged on in a single six-hour stretch. It is not only superlative television, but a reminder of the symbiotic connections between the different arts. Without Sally Rooneys novel, there would be no series. Has there ever been a time when we were in greater need of such works and the insights they offer? ","483"

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominees first public comment on the allegation came at a delicate moment for his campaign.

 Related: Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters 

I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished, Biden wrote in a Medium post on Friday morning. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They arent true. This never happened.
Biden said he would ask the National Archives to make public any record of a complaint his accuser, Tara Reade, says she filed at the time. Biden said any such document would not be kept at the University of Delaware, among his Senate papers.
Im saying unequivocally, it never, never happened, he told MSNBCs Morning Joe.
Reade came forward last month to accuse Biden of sexually assaulting her at a Capitol Hill office complex in spring 1993. His campaign had said the account is false, but Biden had not addressed it.
Asked if he remembered Reade, Biden said he did not remember any type of complaint she may have made.
Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski repeatedly asked if he would authorize a search of his Senate papers. He declined, insisting they do not contain personnel files.
Theyre not there, he said.
In a statement, however, the National Archives said any records of Senate personnel complaints from 1993 would have remained under the control of the Senate.
Asked if he was confident no such complaint existed, Biden offered a qualified response: I know of no one who was aware any complaint was made.
He also said there were no non-disclosure agreements that would prevent women from speaking out.
In a statement, Rainn, an anti-sexual violence organization, called for the release of any and all records that may be relevant, including those housed at the University of Delaware.
We urge him, his campaign and former staff to cooperate fully and provide complete transparency, said Heather Drevna, a spokeswoman.
The race between Biden and Donald Trump, who himself faces  and denies  accusations of sexual assault and misconduct from more than a dozen women, will be the first of the #MeToo era. Republicans have begun to weaponize Reades story while Democrats stand behind Biden.
Brzezinski pressed Biden on his support for Dr Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault during his supreme court confirmation hearings.
Then, Biden said it takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward under bright lights, with millions of people watching, and relive something that happened to her. Ford, he said, should be given the benefit of the doubt and not be, you know, abused again by the system.
Biden said his position was consistent. Women who come forward deserve to start off with the presumption that they are telling the truth, he said.
Then you have to look at the circumstances and the facts and the facts in this case do not exist. They never happened.
Democrats are aware of the importance of female voters. Women are among Trumps fiercest critics and have organized, voted and run for office in record numbers since his election. Biden has vowed to pick a woman as his running mate.
On Friday, Biden pointed to his record as the author of the Violence Against Women Act, and his work as vice-president on combatting sexual assault on college campuses.
Yet he has faced renewed scrutiny over his handling of Anita Hills testimony during the supreme court nomination of Clarence Thomas, who she accused of sexual harassment, in the 1990s. Before Biden launched his campaign, eight women accused him of touching them or displaying affection in ways that made them uncomfortable. Reade was among them.
She did not make her accusation of sexual assault until this year, when she told podcast host Katie Halper Biden allegedly pinned her against a wall and penetrated her with his fingers. Those alleged events were presented to Biden on Morning Joe. He denied them.
Im not going to go in and question her motive, Biden said. Im not going to attack her. She has a right to say whatever she wants to say but I have a right to say, Look at the facts, check it out.
In his statement, Biden said women should be heard, not silenced but said scrutiny of the full and growing record of inconsistencies in [Reades] story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways warranted further examination.
Tina Tchen, president of advocacy group Times Up Now, said: Today, Vice-President Joe Biden sat down and directly addressed the allegation against him with the seriousness it deserves, something that the current president has never done.

 Related: Unemployment is ravaging America. Trump should be worried for November 

In an interview with conservative radio host Dan Bongino, Trump offered Biden advice: I would just say to Joe Biden, Just go out and fight it.
All of a sudden you become a wealthy guy, youre a famous guy, then you become president, and people just  people that youve never seen, that youve never heard of, make charges, Trump said, before turning back to Biden: So I guess in a way you could say Im sticking up for him.
During a White House briefing, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, asserted that the American people have already rendered a verdict on the accusations against Trump, by electing him.
But last year the advice columnist E Jean Carroll alleged Trump raped her in the mid-1990s, which the president denied. A defamation lawsuit from another accuser is currently on hold in New York.
Biden sought to draw a sharp contrast.
We have lived long enough with a president who doesnt think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing, he said. Thats not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.","995"

Our solutions: quick vinegar brine pickle, carrot kraut, roasted carrots confit, carrot juice  its safe to say shell be good for beta-carotene for a while. Lea is not alone. Once you have stepped off the baking train  because really how many more cakes, loaves of sourdough and crumpets can you eat before your blood sugar levels decide to stay permanently spiked  you might find yourself ordering mystery produce boxes for the fun of it. Full disclosure: I am also a purveyor of one such mystery box. Our Boon Luck Farm in Byron has been growing organic heirloom produce for some of Australias well known restaurants. Those restaurants have temporarily closed, so theyre no longer ordering what we specifically grow for them. Im in the same boat as every primary producer whose main business is restaurants.

The creative uses for some of the produce that I am seeing is refreshing, but some produce can be harder to use or use up, and leaves people completely stumped.  Lots of online stores will allow you select the contents  but I urge you to support your local small-scale farmers and buy a grab-bag direct from them, as you will get the freshest seasonal produce with the proceeds going straight to the source. Besides, its more fun that way.  When your box arrives   First, lay everything on your kitchen table or bench. Group the produce like for like: brassicas, lettuces, fruits, herbs, roots etc. Then do as chefs do: wrap them up appropriately for storage, dont wash anything unless you are ready to use it (as it will likely bruise or accelerate the decomposition of the vegetable), and do not pre-cut anything you wont use that day, as the more surface area something has, the faster it dries out.  Wrap your herbs in a moist paper towel, and put anything with leaves into your crisper. Apples, grapes, squashes, cucumbers, leeks, fennel and anything you want crisp goes into the fridge. Pears and avocados depend on the stage of ripeness  if theyre soft, put them into the fridge, otherwise leave them on the bench to ripen more. Citrus, bananas, pumpkins, onions, garlic and potatoes are best left out. If you want to speed up the ripening of bananas and avocados, pop them together in a paper bag  the natural ethanol released will work very well. Pull out pencil and paper and get planning your weeks menu and larder staples.

Related: Easy autumn recipe: brussels sprout, chestnut and bacon soup   Freezing: With pumpkins and sweet potatoes, once the season starts it seems to never end. Theres a reason that grocers sell things by halves, like celery, watermelons and pumpkins. If you are going to cook with a pumpkin or sweet potato, dont just cut the wedge you plan on eating tonight. Cook and process the whole lot. By processing I mean steaming or roasting. Then portion it out into 250g servings and freeze it. Having these on hand means you can defrost to instantly make a soup, curry, warm salad, frittata or even make custard to fill a pie. Dont be afraid to freeze things; most defrost well enough, and need only a little warming in the oven before you can use them. Once its been reheated, use it straight away as refreezing isnt a good idea. Things that can steamed or roasted, then frozen, include peppers, beetroot, carrots, potatoes, swedes, parsnips, onions (best roasted) and most root vegetables. I almost always roast veg with olive oil, grey salt and whole bulbs of garlic de-cloved. The rule is always low and slow. When you come to portion everything out, separate the excess oil and garlic cloves and put them into a jar. This will create a flavoured oil to use in salad dressing, or even for finishing off meats, soups and casseroles. Mashing the roasted garlic on toast is a particular delight. I have mysterious leafy greens     Some greens need long slow cooking, some just a quick blanch and some are best eaten raw in a salad. Photograph: Elenathewise/Getty Images/iStockphoto   Some greens need long slow cooking times, some need just a quick blanch or stir fry and some are just best left alone to eat raw in a salad. Slow braising Woodier greens like cavolo nero, silver beet, radish tops, the tops of any root veg, chicory, cardoons and artichokes (I know theyre not leafy greens but still need to be mentioned) benefit from longer braising. This requires homemade stock or water and olive oil in a 3:1 ratio, plus salt and garlic. At the end of the long simmer, finish off with something acidic like vinegar or citrus. The time depends on the toughness of the leaves, but I find that anything needing a braise longer than 20-30 minutes isnt worth eating. This is a deliciously universal way of cooking vegetables that are a little woodier and benefit from being eaten on the softer side  do not be concerned if the greens turn olive or even brown. Brown food is delicious. Keep adjusting the liquid as you go, not allowing the greens to be swamped, and likewise not drying them out. I really like to finish off a longer braise like this with a contrast of something fresh in at the end, like freshly shelled or frozen peas and a generous fistful of chopped fresh herbs  like flat-leafed parsley. I love eating these greens as a side to some protein, or even a main meal with a fried egg. It also keeps very well refrigerated to snack on later, or to put on toast that youve rubbed with the garlic confit I mentioned earlier. Quick cooking These techniques are for softer greens that are just too horrid to eat raw  water spinach, in fact all spinach, Asian brassicas like Chinese broccoli, choy sum, and even lettuces. By cooking them you will actually unlock more of their nutrients, especially if you add a citric element to it at the end. Either a quick stir fry with some rendered pork fat or a healthy oil like olive or macadamia and chopped garlic and a simple seasoning, or blanching and steaming, work well. For stir frying, let your wok or pan heat up first, add your fat and wait a minute, or use this time to chop up your garlic. If steaming or blanching, leave the water on high until it is full-on boiling then add the vegetables to cook  very minimally. Even once youve turned off the heat, the vegetables will still be cooking, so bear that in mind. I tend to turn the heat off just before I think the vegetables are at point I like to eat them, because the transition time from cooking to plating will make those veggies exactly right. Greens to keep raw Lettuces, salad mixes, radicchio, endive, softer hearts of certain chicories, celery hearts and leaves, sorrel, edible weeds like pennywort, purslane and cranberry hibiscus are all best left cold. Dont forget that even in the raw state, when you add oils, acid and salt, you are essentially cooking it minimally. I could eat salads till the cows come home, and there are a million ways to make it.   Related: Easy cheesy: a comforting bake that works with whatever you have   All you need for inspiration is to taste what is in season and remember the tenets of flavour profiles  salty, sour, sweet, bitter and fat  when you are composing a salad. Add a little of each, tasting as you go. Dont forget that you can always add larder staples like nuts, fresh or dried fruits, cooked grains or cheeses. Layer your sour notes by using different vinegars, citrus juice and zest. Dont forget there are many ways to salt your food that dont even include salt, like fish sauce, anchovies, shrimp paste, Vegemite, seaweed and other sea vegetables, miso, soy sauce or even nutritional yeast. Pull out your frozen roasted vegetables and add those too.  And the rest of it  Use up odds and ends such as off-cuts and peels of carrots, daikon, parsnip, onions, garlic peel, celery and mushrooms in bone stocks (my tip is to roast the bones first for a deeper flavour). These can be portioned out and kept frozen (250mls is my preferred size). If I dont have quite enough to make a large pot, I save everything up in the freezer first until I do. Making stock can feel like a commitment  it is  but once youve finished washing that big pot and your freezer is well stocked up with the future potential of soups, curries, ragu and the like, you will feel an immense satiety. Water kefir is another great way to use up bits and bobs from fruit. Feeding the grains and drinking the byproduct is a source of continual entertainment and probiotics. Water kefir grains can be bought online; I like the Fermentary. Figuring out what to feed my water kefir grains, and the trial and error of flavour combinations, is a source of real joy for me at the moment  lemongrass is a winner, for instance. Cooking from a mystery box is an adventure  the best thing to do is to take a deep breath and dive right in.","1775"

They are the 13 who downloaded the Sydney City Council annual report 2017-18 between Friday 6 September and Monday 9 September last year. Taylor has told parliament this was the timeframe when his staff printed out travel expenses details used in a botched attempt to mock Lord Mayor Clover Moores climate change concerns. He later apologised because the figures he used were bogus. But the central unknown of what otherwise might merely have been a footnote in a book of dumb political smartarsery remains.   Related: 'Nearly beyond belief': Clover Moore demands Angus Taylor explain doctored document   Where did the inaccurate travel expense figures Taylor inadvisedly hurled at Moore come from? Because no one, not police investigator, council officials and Taylors own staff, can find them in the report. He has said his staff didnt concoct them, and nor did he. And it would be pushing a conspiracy theory up a steepish hill to suggest Taylor lied about not making up the numbers. At the very least it would be a stunning act of stupidity for him to think no one would twig to the fakery were he to try it. It seems more likely he was duped by someone, possibly someone outside his office with a conduit to him. Clover Moore has lots of enemies in Sydney who for around 15 years have had to watch voters rebuff attempts to get rid of her. One of them, someone he trusted, might have slipped a dodgy document to Taylor, who saw a chance for an easy cheap hit on Moore and the climate change campaign, in itself an admission the nations energy minister isnt a fan of global warming worries. The fact this episode is still something to speculate about eight months later, that even the minister hasnt, or cant, fluently explain what happened, is a matter of concern. It goes to credibility.   Related: Company part-owned by Angus Taylor illegally poisoned endangered grasslands, investigation finds   The Morrison government has been granted a massive stock of trust as a consequence of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The faith is warranted and the government hopes to mobilise it on non-Covid-19 matters such as economic policy. But a governments credibility chain is as strong as its weakest link, and at the moment that is Angus Taylor, as Labor will point out when parliament returns in two weeks. Whomever might have been involved in production of the exaggerated expense figures most likely would have downloaded the section of the council annual report, and could be one of the September group of 13. Most in the group  a total of 10  downloaded it on 9 September. It is likely they were council staff trying to find a document which Taylor had cited in a letter to Moore and later sent to the Daily Telegraph. The document essentially claimed the council had betrayed Moores call for a climate emergency by spending $15m on emission-spewing domestic and overseas travel. The actual figure was $6,000. NSW police and council staff have said the document with the inflated dollar amount simply doesnt exist. Obviously, you cant print out something that is not there. The annual report was uploaded on 27 November 2018, and the appropriate metadata log shows it was not altered after that, a Senate committee has been told. There was only one version of the report, not several in Word or PDF.   Related: Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison won't be able to brush off uncomfortable questions much longer | Malcolm Farr   That leaves three other downloaders, according to metadata provided by Sydney City Council and made public in a Senate estimates hearing this March. There were two downloaders on 6 September, none on 7 September, and one on 8 September. The IP addresses of all 13 would technically be retrievable and the inquirers identified, but if this has been carried out the names have not been made public. Even if you can accept that the 10-month-old annual report of a capital city council might be fascinating to some, it still is difficult to grasp why three people would download it on a September Friday and the following Sunday. Again, there is no evidence Taylor did the dodgy document deed himself nor that his staff compiled it. But someone did, and it is hard to believe Angus Taylor doesnt know who it was. The importance of this mystery is beyond the curiosity it provokes. Labor wants to solve it when parliament returns on 12 May. The opposition has given notice it will do so in rough and unsparing fashion if needs be. Its not just the allegations of dirty play that Labor will produce. Taylor is seen as a vulnerable character on the government frontbench, and representative of its standards of conduct.","777"

That night, in Melbourne, organisers of the Australian Grand Prix were scrambling to keep the event open despite an 11th hour order from Victorias chief health officer that they could run the race but had to turn spectators away. It would be the first major event in Australia to be cancelled by the coronavirus. Within 24 hours, almost every other flagship event planned for the next month would follow suit.   Related: Can I visit my family or friends? Australias coronavirus lockdown rules and restrictions explained   This is the first 50 days of the shutdown. Day 1  Friday 13 March Spectators queue outside Albert Park in Melbourne for two hours, before the organisers confirm the Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled. Six hours later, Scott Morrison and Australias premiers and chief ministers announce that mass gatherings  events with more than 500 participants  should not take place from Monday onward. They also announce the establishment of a national cabinet to respond to the coronavirus crisis. A level three travel warning is placed against the whole world, with Australians told to avoid unnecessary international travel.

The announcement is made in the Council of Australian Governments meeting (Coag), held in person in Sydney. It is the last time they are all in one room. The prime minister goes in for a handshake with the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, but is rebuffed. Saturday is the round-one NRL match between Morrisons team, the Cronulla Sharks, and the South Sydney Rabbitohs. He tells reporters at the Coag press call at 4pm that he still intends to go. By 8pm, Morrison has reneged on his football attendance, saying it might be misinterpreted. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has tested positive to coronavirus, but his cabinet colleagues are not tested. And the Melbourne Comedy festival, Melbourne Fashion festival and Sydney Royal Easter Show have been cancelled. Australia has 156 cases of coronavirus.

Day 3  Sunday 15 March National cabinet holds its first meeting on the anniversary of the Christchurch massacre. Australia now has 250 cases. Quarantine rules are broadened. From midnight, all international arrivals are required to self-isolate for 14 days, unless they are airline or maritime crew, or transitioning through Australia to the Pacific Islands. The order extends to cruise ship passengers. States and territories will enforce these rules under public health orders. Morrison says there is unanimous agreement from states and territories that schools should remain open following the advice of national cabinets health advisory body, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. He says that once a shutdown measure is introduced it is likely to remain in place for six months. The next morning, Morrison does five media interviews. In four, he is asked why schools remain open. School attendance in NSW has dropped 25%. Day 6  Wednesday 18 March Victorian school attendance has fallen by up to 50%. A fake text message is circulating warning the country would go into an immediate lockdown, and the prime minister bristles when asked about it. Twitter is not real life  so dont believe it, he says. The national chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, says a two to four week shutdown called for by many commentators does not achieve anything.

Day 7  Thursday 19 March At 6am health officials give the all-clear for the 2,700 passengers aboard the cruise ship Ruby Princess to disembark. About 110 have influenza-like symptoms. Three are swabbed, but the rest are not made to wait for the results. They go home, many boarding domestic flights to other states, carrying the virus with them. Within five weeks at least 662 passengers on the Ruby Princess will have tested positive to Covid-19 and 21 will have died.

Later, Scott Morrison announces that Australias borders are now closed to non-citizens and residents. Australians are urged to return home as soon as possible. The Reserve Bank announces a $105bn boost to the economy and cuts the cash rate to 0.25%. The next day, after a national cabinet meeting, the ban on indoor gatherings is refined to include a requirement of 4sqm space per person. Restaurants will have to change their tables accordingly. Schools remain open, but Tasmania does not: the island state announces that anyone who enters will face a 14-day quarantine. Day 10  Sunday 22 March The jobseeker payment is effectively doubled to a minimum base rate of $1,115.70, with an announcement of a fortnightly coronavirus support payment of $550.

The national cabinet meeting is preceded by matching announcements from the NSW and Victorian premiers, saying they are considering a ban on all non-essential services. Victoria and the ACT will close schools from Tuesday, starting the Easter school holidays early. Morrison says he is not annoyed. At the press conference following the national cabinet meeting, ABC political editor Andrew Probyn inadvertently becomes a TikTok meme. Australia passes 1,000 cases on Saturday. By Sunday its 1,316 cases  an increase of 213 in 24 hours. Twenty-six of those cases are from the Ruby Princess. On Monday, thousands of people queue for Centrelink. The queues start forming at 4am and stretch around the block. The pattern is repeated all week. Day 12  Tuesday 24 March National cabinet decides on further restrictions. Auction houses, real estate auctions, eating in shopping centre food courts, amusement parks, play centres, beauty parlours, tattoo parlours, and haircuts that take longer than 30 minutes are banned. The haircut time limit is lifted two days later.    Staff close the main gate at Sydneys Taronga Zoo on 25 March, 2020.

Weddings are limited to five people  the couple, the celebrant and two witnesses. Australians must stay home unless theyre going out for an essential purpose, and the definition of essential is broadened. Now, if you ask me who is an essential worker? Morrison says. Someone who has a job. Domestic travel restrictions on entering Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory come into force. Those who arrive after today will have to self-isolate for 14-days. Queensland is to follow on Wednesday. The international travel warning is upgraded to a travel ban. The next day, all non-urgent elective surgery is suspended. Shock jock Alan Jones, who usually shows little sympathy to those on welfare, says it should be easier to get the dole. In New Zealand, a four week lockdown is announced. It will begin on Thursday. Day 15  Friday 27 March. Prince Charles and Boris Johnson have coronavirus. The United States passes China as the country with the most number of cases. Globally, the number of cases has topped half a million with 22,993 deaths.    Britains prime minister Boris Johnson announces he has tested positive for the new coronavirus, Friday 27 March, 2020. Photograph: AP   Australias total case tally has topped 3,000, doubling in just three days. The daily incidence peak is hit on 28 March. National cabinet announces that from midnight Saturday, all returning international travellers will have to complete their mandatory 14-day quarantine in a hotel. A ban on non-essential travel into remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory comes into effect. Day 17  Sunday 29 March Gatherings are now limited to two people, excluding people who live together. Some states will take this further to ban people from interacting unless they are exercising together or acting as a carer. People over the age of 70 are advised to effectively self-isolate, as are people with chronic disease or comorbidities who are over the age of 60, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples over the age of 50. The national cabinet announces a moratorium on evictions from commercial or residential tenancies for six months, but enforcement is slow and varies between jurisdictions. The curve is beginning to flatten, with the rate of growth dropping from 35% to 15%. To date, 208,000 tests have been conducted, and 3,898 cases have been confirmed. About 98% of tests are negative. Australia is testing more than four times the number of people per head of population than the UK, and more people per head of population than South Korea. Day 18  Monday 30 March The Australian government announces a $130bn wage subsidy package called jobkeeper. Eligible businesses will receive $1,500 per employee per fortnight, to be paid in full directly to the employee, if they can show a significant loss in revenue. It brings the total value of economic stimulus packages announced to $320bn, or 16.4% of GDP. Victoria and Queensland both issue their first fine on a business for breaching social distancing laws. States and territories release new public health orders, detailing the strict enforcement of the stay at home rules, with on-the-spot fines of $1,000 or more. Journalists spend the next few days seeking clarity on whether the laws restrict visits from romantic partners. Three days later, the federal government announces that childcare will be free for six months. Day 24  Sunday 5 April Police in New South Wales announce a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle, which is now the single largest source of coronavirus infections in Australia. Some 662 of the 5,687 coronavirus cases reported in Australia are from that ship, as are 11 of the 34 deaths. The global coronavirus tally passed 1 million cases two days ago.    NSW police officers ask people to move on at Rushcutters Bay park in Sydney, Wednesday, 1 April, 2020. Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP   At 11.59pm the hard border in WA comes into effect. Only residents or those who meet a set criteria for entry are now allowed through. Queensland will strengthen it border restrictions from 11 April. NSW, Queensland and Victoria are stricter in their enforcement of social distancing rules than other states. Two days ago, the WA premier, Mark McGowan, was overcome with laughter at a description of a man in NSW being fined for stopping to buy a kebab on the way home from a run. Soon, police would be accused of being too heavy handed and discriminatory in their use of the unfettered powers to stop people and judge the reason for being outside. On 7 April, Scott Morrison says the Easter long weekend could cause another spike in cases. Stay at home, he says. Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse. April brings a change in the type of questions asked at press conferences. Where in March reporters asked for tougher restrictions  (Why not an immediate four week lockdown? Why are schools still open?)  April sees calls for the lockdown measures to be lifted. Rightwing pundits reach for utilitarianism and argue the prime minister is letting his Christianity get in the way of economic pragmatism. Day 31  Sunday 12 April Easter Sunday. There is an outbreak in Tasmania. The premier, Peter Gutwein, announces the immediate closure of two hospitals in the states north-west and orders 1,000 healthcare workers  and the 4,000 people they live with  to quarantine for 14 days. The area is now under the strictest lockdown provisions in the country. All non-essential business is banned.    The North West Regional Hospital is seen closed in Burnie, Tasmania, Tuesday, April 14, 2020. Photograph: Simon Sturzaker/AAP    The North West Regional hospital is seen closed in Burnie, Tasmania, Tuesday, 14 April, 2020.  The outbreak is traced back to two passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, who were the first two people to die in Tasmania after testing positive to Covid-19. Murphy repeats rumours to a New Zealand parliamentary committee that the virus spread because healthcare workers held an illegal dinner party, but a police investigation would later find there was no evidence to suggest such a party occurred. The health services union says the spread was due to doctors and nurses working across infected wards. Five days later, the prime minister will also be slapped down by Tasmanian authorities for incorrectly suggesting a healthcare worker had deliberately withheld information from contact tracers. Day 35  Thursday 16 April The first hearing of the royal commission into the summer bushfires, a crisis that was for one month the defining issue of the year, is held via videolink. The national cabinet agrees to lift social distancing restrictions if three conditions are met. They are: boosting the testing regime to include extensive surveillance or sentinel testing of asymptomatic people; stronger contact tracing, including the use of a tracing app; and improved local response capability to quickly shut down any new outbreaks. If that happens and the basic reproduction number remains below one  meaning that each infection leads to less than one new infection  then, in four weeks, restrictions may be lifted.    Covidsafe app on an iphone in Sydney on 27 April, 2020. Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty Images   Every state except Tasmania currently has a reproduction rate of less than one. Restrictions will loosen gradually, Morrison says. Singapore is now a warning: lift restrictions too quickly and you could face a second wave. Day 39  Monday 20 April Western Australia and Queensland join South Australia and the Northern Territory in reporting no new cases of coronavirus. Its the first day without a new case in WA since 21 February. South Australia has just made three days in a row, despite expanding its testing regime. Nationally, its the lowest daily new case count since early March, with just 26 new cases. For the past nine days, the average daily growth rate has been less than 1%. The curve is bent. More than two-thirds of the countrys 6,613 cases have now recovered, and 434,000 tests have been completed. The next day, the national cabinet announces it will lift the ban on many types of non-urgent elective surgery from 27 April. Virgin Australia, Australias second biggest airline, goes into administration.

Day 42  Thursday 23 April The Ruby Princess departs Australia for the Philippines with 500 crew members onboard. A NSW inquiry investigating the debacle holds its second day of hearings. The tax office has approved 456,000 applications from people seeking early access to their superannuation, with an average withdrawal of $8,000. Centrelink has processed 587,686 jobseeker applications, more than they usually would in a year. More than 900,000 businesses have expressed interest in the jobkeeper payment, and 275,000 have made formal applications. Brendan Murphy tells a parliamentary select committee that to ease restrictions Australia would have to be able to test like weve never tested before. WA premier Mark McGowan, asked at a Perth press conference when he would ease restrictions, says: Its a funny thing. A few weeks ago I was literally being screamed at to lock down, lock down everything. Now the calls are that we need to open up. He said that schools were expected to return to onsite learning from Monday and parents should demand a refund from private schools that dont comply. The next day, Morrison rebukes the aged care sector for going above the recommended restrictions and denying visitors even when no outbreak has been detected. Murphy announces that all states have expanded their testing regimes, the first step in establishing sentinel testing. Responding to comments made by US president Donald Trump, Murphy says he would caution against the injection of disinfectants as a potential treatment for Covid-19. Another outbreak is unfolding at an aged care home in western Sydney. Day 44  Saturday 25 April The prime ministers Anzac Day address from the Australian War Memorial is broadcast live into homes because ceremonies and marches are cancelled. Instead, lit candles are placed in driveways.    Vietnam veteran David Milligan in a minutes silence outside his home at dawn in Mallacoota, Gippsland, Saturday, 25 April, 2020.

The next day, the government releases the Covidsafe app, designed to assist contact tracing by making a record of everyone a user has been in contact with for more than 15 minutes. The information can only be accessed by state health authorities and is automatically deleted after 21 days. The use of the app is not compulsory, but it is linked to an easing of restrictions. If we want to get back to sport then we need to download the app, Morrison says. By Wednesday evening, the app has three million downloads and the federal government has a new catchphrase: for a covid-safe Australia, download the Covidsafe app. Day 47  Tuesday 28 April Gladys Berejiklian follows Mark McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk in announcing a relaxation of social distancing laws. Berejiklian says the change  which allows people to visit family and friends without being penalised  is a mental health measure. Ill still be standing outside the house when I visit my parents, she says. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says he does not intend to loosen his states lockdown provisions, which expire on 11 May. Thats also the target date for the AHPPC reviewing stay-at-home measures. In Western Australia, people are now allowed to gather in groups of 10 either indoors or outdoors. Hiking, boating, fishing, camping, and holding a picnic or a barbecue are all now permitted, but regional travel restrictions and the hard border remain in place. Four people die at western Sydney aged care home Newmarch House in a 24-hour period, bringing the number of deaths at that facility linked to the coronavirus to 11. Managers at the centre say they expect more deaths to follow.

The Logies are cancelled, followed by the Royal Melbourne Show. The number of cases in the United States passes one million, with a death toll of 58,220  more than the number of US lives lost in the Vietnam War. Day 50  Friday, 1 May The Australian Capital Territory enters the day with no active cases of Covid-19, with 103 people recovered and three dead. Loosened restrictions in New South Wales and Queensland take effect. North of the border, family groups are allowed to go for picnics or to a national park; to eat a takeaway meal outside instead of scurrying back into their homes; to take a leisure drive within a 50km radius of their home address; and to shop for frivolities. In New South Wales, people are allowed to have up to two visitors in their home, or visit other people. In the Northern Territory, which has not had a new case of Covid-19 in weeks, the parks are reopened. Fishing, camping, outdoor weddings and funerals and attending the local swimming pool are back on the cards. In two weeks time residents will be allowed to go to the pub, provided they only stay for two hours and also order food. By 18 June, according to a plan outlined by chief minister Michael Gunner, everything will be back to normal. The national cabinet moves forward its decision on easing restrictions to next Friday, 8 May. We need to restart our economy, we need to restart our society. We cant keep Australia under the doona, we need to move ahead, Morrison says.","3469"

But some of us are in more danger than others: physically, mentally, socially, economically. Not only from the virus itself but from some of the social and political responses to it.
From First Nations people experiencing homelessness being issued with move-on notices to asylum seekers in detention, from frontline health workers to frontline retail workers, from casuals and contractors to visa holders, Covid-19, while imposing a common danger upon all of us, heightens the pre-existing contrasts in society, forcing us to focus on the glaring structural inequalities upon which our economy is built.
The danger we are all in, and the unequal distribution of this danger, means that the ideological fixation on going it alone has been blown out of the water. The common danger, and the hyper-danger for some of us within it, poses a singular social question, a social question so all-encompassing that it resonates with the plethora of personal questions each of us has.

How do we protect ourselves as a society? We cannot depend on a fractured society or a fragmented economy to deliver collective healing and health. Or jobs. Or sustainability. Or social morale.
We also know that the bushfire crisis, since it is a symptom of the climate emergency, has not gone away. It is, to use the prime ministers favoured concept, in hibernation.
The Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has recently written:

... the first priority is to restore our balance: provide more funding for the public sector, especially for those parts of it that are designed to protect against the multitude of risks that a complex society faces, and to fund the advances in science and higher-quality education, on which our future prosperity depends  Even as we emerge from this crisis, we should be aware that some other crisis surely lurks around the corner. We cant predict what the next one will look like  other than it will look different from the last.

Alongside strengthening the social security system and expanding the wage subsidy to include casuals and visa holders the commonwealth government needs to expand the public sector.
Not only to create jobs but to protect the community. We need, as a massive structural augmentation, a significantly enhanced and expanded public sector. Im not just talking about an expansion of infrastructure and staffing levels; we need to re-imagine the public sphere, expanding our view of its role in building a common future based on the common good, a view that has been displaced by the false construct of austerity coupled with the ideology of the market knows (and does everything) best.
I write this at a time when the government has shamefully allowed the austerity impulse to kick in vis a vis the public sector, imposing an economically irrational and socially harmful wage freeze on public sector workers.
It is not my intention to provide a comprehensive list of infrastructure projects. Because we need a robust, participatory and transparent process by which this is determined (as opposed to the sports rorts model!), rationally mapped out on the basis of current and projected social and economic need.
This is work that must begin now. The first priority should be the provision of a significant social and economic infrastructure investment to First Nations communities, the shape of which, and this cannot be emphasised too strongly, should be determined by those communities. As Lorena Allam points out: Crowding in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities occurs at around three times the rate of the non-Indigenous population, with over 115,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander households living in overcrowded homes nationwide.
We need a massive injection of public resources into the construction of public housing. The Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute has estimated that, facing a shortfall of 433,000 social housing dwellings, we need to triple our stock of social housing by 2036. If we fail to meet this housing need we are looking down the barrel of a worsening homelessness and housing stress crisis.
Bad for the economy. Disastrous for peoples lives.
Other obvious and urgent areas of expansion include Services Australia (building on the governments recently announced boost to Centrelink staff, whilst cognisant of the staffing cuts since 2013 and the ridiculous capping of the APS to 2006-07 staffing levels or below) and the public health system (physical infrastructure and staffing levels, including community health and aged and community care).

Also, the progressive replacement of the jobactive network with a fit-for-purpose commonwealth employment service, a good opportunity to scrape such barnacles as the hyper-exploitative PaTH, the dead-end work-for-the-dole, the inherently racist Community Development Program and the punitive ParentsNext.
The centrepiece of reconstruction should be a social guarantee, with full employment at its heart. The Curtin governments 1945 white paper on full employment saw an expanded public sector as a means not only of creating jobs but of building social and economic infrastructure.
The times demand a 21st century vision akin to this. A vision that recognises and properly remunerates the heavily gendered work of caring, that values the role of arts workers in the public sphere, that treats broadband as essential infrastructure (and, given that it is right now the only highway we get anywhere on, removes the bloody tolls and ditches the digital divide!).
We should address the obscene levels of casualisation and precarity, invest in community infrastructure, social services, disability services. We should have a vision with an actual industry policy that embraces the opportunities of a post-carbon economy, a vision that enables and encourages equitable access to higher education and that values and boosts research and innovation instead of lazily leaving it to a private sector that cannot be expected to fill the strategic role that government has so spectacularly abrogated.
Although, as the economist Mariana Mazzucato points out, this abrogation is exactly what has been expected of governments according to the neoliberal framework conjured up by narrow interests: Since the 1980s, governments have been told to take a back seat and let business steer and create wealth, intervening only for the purpose of fixing problems when they arise.

We have a right to expect more from government. We have a right to expect government to do what markets cannot, namely, achieve collectively what we cannot achieve alone: social and economic protection for all of us.
A social guarantee encompasses all that makes people feel human and valued as members of a society. It means no one missing out on the essentials of life: a place to live, a place to work (and decent income support for those who cannot), a place to learn, a place to heal. It means, for example, an overhaul of education funding so that public schools and the education workforce are properly invested in, rather than being allowed to languish in fulfilment of the ideological fantasy that giving more to already well-resourced private schools is somehow equitable. As for Tafe, successive governments have allowed this national treasure to be denuded in the false interests of competition. It is time to right this wrong.

This virus has interrupted ceremony, everything that we do, our right to travel across the country, Sumner says. But you can learn things from this.
Sumner is 72, a Ngarrindjerri cultural ambassador whose country is along the Murray river in the Coorong. Hes an actor, on the London stage last year in Andrew Bovells adaptation of Kate Grenvilles The Secret River, and he has travelled Europe repatriating the remains of his ancestors, most recently from Leipzig, Edinburgh and London in 2019.
Sumners wings are clipped for now, though, as we talk about survival and resilience on the phone from his home in Adelaide, while he holds his sleepy two-year-old grandson on his lap.
Weve lived in this country for thousands and thousands of years and weve come up against all sorts of things within our existence in this land. Even though this is a bad virus, well get through it because Aboriginal people dont realise how strong we are, Sumner says.
A lot of people dont realise, just because were not up to number one on the western societys measuring stick. But we know how to survive in this land, weve been here for a long time and the laws have been there with us, how we respected each other, how we did all sorts of ceremonies. We should really get back to that, because at the moment were living in a way that is really alien to us.

Sumner points out that Europeans may have been in Australia for 250 years on the east coast, but contact history is very recent elsewhere. Songlines are unbroken.
Its only a 100 years here, and further north it may be only 90 years. Its not that long. Even here in South Australia, we are still practising our ceremonies, were still practising men and women ceremonies.
We are dancing about the land, about healing the land and healing the rivers. But most of all, we are dancing about healing ourselves, because weve been damaged, our culture has been damaged. We have, as nations of people across this country been damaged, but by using ceremony, we can bring ourselves back to the land, he says.

Sumner was among hundreds who gathered at a healing ceremony along the Baaka (Darling river) late last year, worried for the health of the Murray-Darling system, from Queensland to the Coorong.
Some of the Murray cod [who died] were over a hundred years old. They died in their own environment. And I thought, when is it our turn? Because Ngarrindjerri, we consider some of the fish as ngarritji, which means my best friend. They are ngarritji and people would translate that to mean totems. When our totems die, when is it our turn? Is it happening now, when were dying in our own environment?

We need to take notice about the world, about the environment, about diseases.
When did the first really bad disease come to this country? With Captain Cook.
Ngarrindjerri have a word for spirit that lives inside of us. And that spirit lives in our stomach area. And we call that spirit the miwi. Its the spirit that tells us right from wrong. Everyones got it. You know when you feel theres something wrong, you dont feel it in your mind or in your heart. You feel it in your stomach. And in some of us, that spirit is gone. That fire has gone out. We need to rekindle and relight that fire in a way that people will have that feeling back.
As elders around the world, we need to teach, so that later on down the track all these children, theyll be respected elders.
When we look to the future, we have to take our culture with us. We dont leave it back there, we bring it with us so that every day we practise it. Its not a religion, its not a church or anything. Its just things we do.
Lockdown is an opportunity to think differently about ways to transmit culture, Sumner says, including embracing technology.

Sumner pauses, thinking aloud about all the millions of people trying to deal with the virus and the fear and anxiety it generates.
What Id say is learn your culture, learn who you are. Because what were doing today, everyone forgets where we come from.
We all had a traditional way that we lived. We all had songs. We all had dance. We all had our own laws designed for that country. They were designed so that we would live and respect the country, but also respect ourselves.
While were in isolation, learn and practise. Start practising stuff that you never practised before or didnt know about your own culture, your own ceremonies. Start practising them with your family that you live with.

Oxfam sends aid around the world, including funding work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia and fair trade producers in 18 countries. Guardian Australia has confirmed that discussions began with staff earlier this week, and Oxfam had decided to redesign the organisation. The charity is planning to reduce the number of full-time staff from 185 to 94 between now and October. Oxfam Australia chief executive Lyn Morgain said it was an exceptionally challenging financial environment, with the charity having a reduction in donations during the summer bushfires in Australia, leading into the coronavirus pandemic.   Related: Don't dismiss philanthropy: it's crucial during the coronavirus crisis | Beth Breeze and Paul Ramsbottom   Oxfam Australia entered the coronavirus crisis in a weakened financial position because of multiple factors that are impacting on the sector, including the fallout from the Australian bushfires, several years of reduced fundraising income and a persistent decline in the overseas aid budget, she said in a statement. Oxfams life-saving work is needed now more than ever to respond to the coronavirus and multiple other crises that threaten to increase the number of people living in poverty and exacerbate inequality. But at the same time, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic has underscored the urgent need for changes that were already under way at Oxfam. Final decisions about the roles are yet to be made, with staff consultations under way, but Morgain said in order to be financially stable, Oxfam needed to reduce costs. Incredibly tough decisions are being made and there will be job losses. We know this is an extremely difficult time for our dedicated and passionate staff  and these decisions in no way reflect their performance.

A spokeswoman for Oxfam said the charity was still working out whether it was eligible for the federal governments jobkeeper program.

Young Harvey, who is in good health, was due on 1 April, but that early arrival gave him and his family, especially the grandparents, a brief, lucky window to meet him for the first time before nearly everything closed. On Friday, New South Wales partially relaxed its restrictions so that two adults (and any dependent children) can visit any other household  as long as you still keep your physical distance. On Saturday, Queenslanders will be allowed to travel up to 50km for recreation, like picnics or exercise, and the national parks will be reopened. Western Australia relaxed its own laws on Monday.   Related: NSW coronavirus restrictions will be partially lifted to allow limited visiting   For Matt and his wife Julia, in Sydney, this means they can go down the road to visit his sister, and introduce Harvey to his uncle and cousins. But theyre playing it safe, and wont be taking him to see his grandparents for at least a few weeks more. It is a very interesting time to bring a young person in the world, Williams says. The current situation in some hospitals is even the father cant go in with the birthing mothers  so we were very lucky to have missed that.    Lisa Villani (L) with Deb Mansfield (R). The friends will reunite on Sunday as restrictions ease in NSW. Photograph: Lisa Villani   For Lisa Villani, Fridays relaxation of restrictions means she can see her friend Deb Mansfield, who is recovering from surgery. Mansfield, 43, is a visual artist and former university lecturer, who now works in the disability sector. The pair met seven years ago and, until the shutdown, worked together at a pottery workshop. In some of my toughest times, Deb has been the family in Sydney I didnt have. She checks in. She delivers baked goods. She sends gifts, Villani says.   Related: Coronavirus numbers in Australia: how many new cases are there? Covid-19 map, statistics and graph   A few weeks ago, Mansfield visited (from 1.5 metres away, Villani adds) and told her they had found a growth on her ovary. She went in a week later for surgery. Before the hospital visit, they had kept in touch through a virtual passata-making class. Now they cant wait to do the same in person. I felt so helpless at a distance, not being able to see her or support her in the lead-up to and after her surgery, Villani says. As soon as the new rules were announced, she invited Mansfield over for dinner. In Byron Bay, Damian Brady, 39, and wife Lisa Webb, 36, say that the restrictions on gatherings have been especially hard on their young kids  who have been missing their friends. We pulled Harry, our oldest, out of daycare as soon as the virus started spreading in Australia, Brady says.  Its been a month and a half since he played with another kid. Its difficult to explain to Harry why he cant get close to people or play on playgrounds, and all his social activities like daycare, swimming lessons and circus arts stopped cold. Thankfully our youngest is only four months old so it hasnt affected her much. But as parents of two children, Brady and Webb are looking forward to the break as much as for themselves as the kids. The last time we had a catch-up with any friends for any longer than a few minutes was sometime in February, he says. For my wife and I, its just been extremely isolating. We can talk to neighbours at a distance, but for most part its just the four of us in a house 24/7. We rarely went out before things changed, but it was always an option if we needed a break. And the family reunions will still have to wait. The pair are originally from Queensland, and the state border is still closed to people who arent residents or essential workers. Most of our friends and all the grandparents are in Brisbane, Brady says. It shows how, though the lockdowns are partially relaxed, there is still much that people cant or arent quite ready to do yet. Regardless, any outing feels like a blessing. We wont go all out  for us its about extending our isolation circle just a little to feel a bit more human, Brady says. Harry being able to play with another kid is something Im really looking forward to. I know he is.","721"
"2020-05-01T20:00:03Z","environment","Environment","Australia listened to the experts on coronavirus. It's time we heard them on climate change"," Were already being swamped with ideas about reforms needed to recover from the pandemic crisis. But the word reform is like gift wrap  a handy cover for any offering, thought-through or otherwise. Perhaps we should ditch the word entirely, and with it the forest of feelpinions about what governments must do to advance an authors previously-held ideological positioning in the post-corona world. Imagine if we took just two lessons from the way Australian governments responded to the coronavirus: that good decisions are made when they consider the evidence and the best available expert advice; and that policy-making can accommodate reasonable differences of opinion, without becoming a war. Think, as Laura Tingle did in a piece for the ABCs 7.30 this week, of the difference it would make if interviewers and commentators allowed room for discussion of complex and competing ideas, before demanding that politicians rule them in or out, or before finding a backbencher who will say they might cross the floor on a policy that conflicts with their ideological prejudice  even if that policy hasnt yet been outlined.   Related: Australia's electricity grid could run with 75% renewables, market operator says   Now consider if those principles were applied to climate policy in Australia. I concede thats quite a leap given the past decade of mind-numbing debate, during which experts have struggled to get a look in. But in the background, some have been giving it a shot. For six years now leading business, environmental, investor, union, farming and social welfare groups have been trying, largely in vain, to create a space for a sensible discussion about global heating, and to give Australian politicians a way to retreat from the self-defeating culture war that has scuppered all attempts at policy. They wouldnt put it this way, but in effect the environmentalists, desperate for Australia to make some meaningful move towards reducing emissions, and the business groups, desperate for some kind of investment certainty, have been trying to save Australias politicians from themselves. The starting point for the Australian Climate Roundtables deliberations is that Australia needs to reach net zero emissions, and that delaying action just increases the cost of reaching that goal. Unremarkable propositions in any fact-based forum, but in some Coalition circles, still close to heresy. Now the roundtable, including its business members, argues that this post-corona reconstruction is a chance to speed up decarbonising the economy.   Related: Covid-19 crisis will wipe out demand for fossil fuels, says IEA   The Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, argued in an opinion piece that the post-corona discussion should divest itself of ideological constraints. In resuscitating our economy, we can tackle some of our most vexed problems. Every dollar we invest in energy should be a dollar towards a lower carbon economy and lower energy bills, she wrote. And expert evidence about what might be possible has been flooding in by the day. The Australian Energy Market Operator this week released its long awaited renewable integration study, which found Australia could accommodate levels of up to 75% instant penetration of wind and solar in its main grid by 2025  that we have the know-how, but need to update market and regulatory settings. Think about that next time someone starts burbling on about the impossibility of a renewable-dependent grid coping when the wind dont blow and the sun dont shine. Less than a year after an election in which Bill Shortens target of 45% renewables by 2030 was attacked for being unachievable and economy wrecking, the expert market operator says 75% is technically achievable  and in just five years time. And then there was the advice from the International Energy Agency this week that renewable electricity will be the only energy source resilient to the biggest global energy shock in 70 years, triggered by the pandemic. The Morrison government is supposed to be working on a roadmap towards some kind of long-term emissions reduction policy, understandably delayed while it deals with the pandemic. It could draw on the work of a bunch of expert groups who have already had a go  the latest Climateworks report released earlier this month found that net zero emissions by 2035 is possible in Australia, using technologies that are mostly already mature and available. The CSIROs roadmap released last year found there was no trade-off between economic growth and transitioning to zero emissions, and in fact strong action could lead to GDP growth, an increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050.   Related: Investors call on Australia's largest oil and gas company to set greenhouse targets   But then, apparently pre-empting his own policy, and contradicting his own governments claim to be technology neutral, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has spent the week calling for a gas-fired recovery, variously advocating more gas-peaking plants, more long-term gas supply for manufacturers and more onshore gas production. The details of what hes advocating remain opaque, but as the Grattan Institutes energy expert Tony Wood points out, renewed suggestions of government intervention are only likely to deter investment, presumably the opposite of what Taylor is seeking. If theres a coherent policy in there somewhere, it really is time for the government to unwrap it. The experts have been waiting for years, and it turns out that listening to them is a good idea.","845"

The more savvy professionals involved are exercising caution about the governments position, after another oddly judged intervention this week by Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, who said that  health guidance permitting  he wanted to get football up and running  as soon as possible.   Related: Premier League clubs united in desire to find way to finish season after meeting   Bill Shanklys classic quip about the importance of football when manager of the club who could still be crowned 2020 champions whatever happens, was cast in terribly serious perspective after the horrors of Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s. Now, considering whether to play professional football in the middle of a pandemic is literally a matter of life and death. One of footballs perennial failings is to inflate its obsession into a bubble in which the great games dramas, outcomes, personalities and controversies seal it off into an alternative world which can feel somehow as significant as everything else. Hearing Boris Johnson mention our current success in dealing with coronavirus, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, deny that allowing the virus to run through the population and achieve herd immunity was ever part of their plan and the refusal by the government to admit to a single failure, they often appear to be creating a bubble of their own. For people not in the front line of the NHS or caring professions, and not stricken personally by the virus, lockdown can make the horror of this situation feel unreal. But 27,000 people in the UK have died, each one a tragedy and grievous blow to a family. Into the second week in March, Dowden and his government were still encouraging people to go to matches and the Cheltenham Festival, based on scientists advice that mass gatherings pose a low risk of virus transmission. Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College explained that with reference to the Liverpool v Atltico Madrid match played on 11 March. Some people will have got infected, he said of the transmission potential of mass gatherings, and if it hadnt happened they wouldnt have been. But he went on to explain that at a population level, stopping them has a marginal impact. But in normal circumstances we do not think of a risk to some lives as marginal because they are not many as a proportion of the whole population; normally everything is aimed at saving and preserving life. Most of the talk in football now is about how players and staff could be tested, somehow housed in a sterile environment, how they might ingeniously be tiptoed into empty stadiums while the rest of the population are still largely housebound. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, was criticised by the club itself for raising public health concerns about games restarting, but however in-depth the planning may be to avoid people massing outside the stadium or gathering instinctively to celebrate, he was sounding a genuine alarm about risks.   Related: Championship makes plan to hold play-offs even if season not completed   To be balanced against those lethal hazards are the benefits of trying so hard to stage matches again. As seven weeks have gone by since football suspended itself on 13 March, against the advice of Dowden and his government that it was fine to carry on into that weekend, the significance of promotion, relegation and Champions League qualification has been put into perspective by the pandemics elemental threat. Now the urge to play is articulated more as a grim job of having to get the season done to avoid difficult conversations with broadcasters, and be able to keep their money. After Dowden spoke up in parliament, more than one senior football executive told the Guardian this week they felt uneasy, as if the government needs some good news, some entertainment for the masses, and that lies behind their desire to get the Premier League playing as soon as possible. Dowden said in parliament that this would help release resources through the rest of the system, but the EFL is understood to be baffled by that, as no more money will go down the football pyramid now if the Premier League starts playing again. In France, where the number of people killed by Covid-19 is lower than in Britain, the government has banned team sports until September and, however much the odd club such as Lyon may grumble, Ligue 1 is cancelled, and the summer is cleared of yet another complication, to try to address the virus. If that were to happen here, however much football people are missing the game and would love current realities to be different, many people could usefully calm down. The financial situation, of course difficult, will probably be just about manageable. If that did happen, the Premier League could concentrate on being true to the principle it has stressed throughout and did again on Friday: The thoughts of all are with those directly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and: The Premier Leagues priority is the health and safety of players, coaches, managers, club staff, supporters and the wider community.","857"

I am still able to nod off fairly easily, and unlike many, my sleep is not often broken with fits of staring anxiously at the ceiling. I am, however, waking up much earlier, well before dawn. I live in a very quiet suburb at the best of times  the nearest train line and major highway half an hours walk away. But lately, in the pre-dawn darkness, the world outside my window is as still as death: no car engines warming up in commuters driveways, no pounding footfall of joggers on a pre-work run. All is unnervingly silent, as if the world is broken and I am alone with my dark thoughts. But then I hear those first, welcome notes. Some mornings its the comforting soft carolling of the Australian magpie, others its the repetitive, urgent piping of gangs of noisy miners. Soon they will be joined by the silvery song of the grey butcherbird, the smaller cousin of the magpie whose large beak tricks people into thinking they are baby kookaburras. The local pied currawongs might chip in with their evocative chimes resonating in the stillness. The screech of rainbow lorikeets hurtling towards their morning feast of nectar from the neighbourhood flowering gums punctuate the air.   Related: 'I can see a bird. What is it?': a beginners' guide to backyard birding   The sepulchre of night is peeled back as the world turns towards the light of the new day. Listening to the contributions of each member of the voluble choir spurs feelings of wonder and gratefulness to be alive on our sublime planet. The dawn chorus reconnects me to life; a sense of hope returns. It is my favourite moment of each of these strange, new days. Birds link sky and earth, they migrate across hemispheres, traverse the vast oceans. From Indigenous creation stories to Aristophanes to the Norwegian myths of Odin and his two ravens that report daily to him about their flights around the globe, birds were considered as messengers, connecting us to other realms. Roman auguries took this literally, interpreting bird behaviour as signs from the gods. In our noisy, industrial society, birdsong has largely been drowned out, all too easy to ignore. However, in the quietude of lockdown and isolation many of us have once again become attuned to their sound breaking the silence. BirdLife Australia has been inundated with people wanting to share or have identified the birds who have been visiting their garden.  One Melbourne birdwatcher started an online movement, #birdthefeckathome which encourages people to record birds they have seen in their backyards. Since launching at the end of March, the site has logged over 2,600 species  around a quarter of the worlds birds. In the radio talkback segments Ive been doing, callers are freaking out that the birds were going crazy but almost all the behaviours described were fairly standard for Australian birds who are a gregarious and outlandish lot.    Rainbow lorikeets captured in a small nature reserve in Sydney Photograph: Rita VP/Guardian Community   The difference is, confined to our homes all day, surrounded by a quiet most of us have never experienced, we are noticing for the first time the daily soap operas of the feathered characters we share our surrounds with. Even in the high-rise midst of our city centres people are noticing cockatoos, currawongs and pigeons living pretty much as they did before the virus. Birdsong still welcomes the dawn every morning and I find enormous comfort in that. This is why on Sunday I plan to rise early and acknowledge the joy those sounds bring as part of International Bird Chorus Day. It was started by British naturalist Chris Baines in 1984 who roped in some friends to celebrate a significant birthday by joining him to listen for the first bird calls of the day. At this time of year, the migrant songbirds have returned to the English countryside and fill the air with their sweet, lilting warblings. Though some, such as Adam Lindsay Gordon and his songless, bright birds or more recently  and more delightfully  Sam Neill and his raven impersonations might regard Australian birds as a raucous cacophony, the fact is that songbirds evolved in Australia and our birds, as vocally splendid as they are boldly marked, do not need the impetus of spring to belt out a squawk or two. On Sunday I will be listening for these comforting, yet bittersweet sounds  palpable reminders of the natural world I am cut off from, while at the same time providing me an essential connection to the world I once knew, the world to which I want to return.

 Related: Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade 

Michigans Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, should he said make a deal with the demonstrators.
The governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire, the president wrote in a tweet on Friday morning. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.
Some of the demonstrators in Lansing on Thursday carried assault rifles, causing alarm among legislators.
Some protesters, many without face coverings, entered the statehouse and demanded to be let on to the House floor, which is not allowed. The gallery was closed to the public to allow room for representatives and reporters to spread apart. 
Some demonstrators in the Senate gallery were openly carrying guns, which is legal. One senator said some armed men shouted at her. Some senators wore bulletproof vests.
Outside, speakers took turns addressing a crowd on the statehouse lawn and drivers leaned on their horns, a repeat of what occurred on 15 April but not close to the thousands who participated in vehicles that day, paralyzing traffic for miles. Trump expressed support for that protest and similar rallies in other states.
In one tweet, Trump appealed to supporters of gun rights when he wrote: LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!
Many of his critics accused him of inciting violence against Democratic governors and lawmakers. Tweets about a potential armed conflict with the federal government increased in the hours after the liberate tweets were sent.
At the White House later on Friday, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked if it was appropriate for the president to express support for protests in which long guns were carried. McEnany answered that the president supported the right to protest within the law and while following federal social distancing guidelines.
Shanon Banner, a Michigan state police spokeswoman, said statehouse protesters who did not wear masks or distance themselves were not issued tickets. 
Whitmer is rated as a possible vice-presidential pick for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to face Trump in November.
In Lansing on Thursday, placards read Shut down the lockdown, No work no freedom and Tyrants get the rope. Some people wore the historic Dont Tread On Me flag as a cape. Others chanted Lock her up, in reference to the governor. Some wore Trumps Make America Great Again hats or carried signs supporting him.
Banner estimated there were 400 to 700 protesters and said they were peaceful overall. One was arrested, for assaulting another demonstrator.







Inside the statehouse, the Republican-led Michigan legislature refused to extend the states coronavirus emergency declaration and voted to authorize a lawsuit challenging Whitmers authority and actions to combat the pandemic.
The governor responded with orders stating under one law that an emergency still exists, while declaring a new 28-day state of emergency under another law.
The declarations are important because they are the foundation for Whitmers stay-at-home measure, and other directives aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.
Late on Thursday, Whitmer extended the closure of bars, casinos and other public places through 28 May. She also continued a ban on dine-in service at restaurants.
The virus that causes Covid-19 has infected more than 41,000 Michigan residents and contributed to the deaths of 3,789, many in the Detroit area.
Republicans accused Whitmer of ignoring their input.

The house speaker, Lee Chatfield, of Levering, said the death toll was terrible, but other lives had been negatively impacted unnecessarily because of how we have handled this pandemic. We believe we you can prioritize public health yet be reasonable in your approach to fighting Covid.
We can no longer allow one person to make decisions for 10 million people, said the Senate majority leader, Mike Shirkey, of Clarklake.
Democrats opposed the legislation as an unconstitutional political stunt.
We must ensure that our state can respond quickly and decisively to a situation that changes day by day, said the representative Tyrone Carter, a Detroit Democrat who recovered from Covid-19. That means ensuring that our governor has the emergency powers necessary to lead us in this fight.
Whitmer accused Republicans of putting their heads in the sand and putting more lives and livelihoods at risk.
Im not going to let that happen, she said.","737"

Although we expect that you will testify on a voluntary basis, we reserve the right to resort to compulsory process if necessary, seven leaders of the House judiciary committee, including the chair Jerry Nadler, wrote in a letter to the Amazon CEO on Friday. Representative David Cicilline, the chair of the Houses antitrust subcommittee who has been leading investigations into the major internet platforms, further stated on Twitter that he is considering a referral to prosecutors.   Related: 'Heads we win, tails you lose': how America's rich have turned pandemic into profit   As CEO and founder of the company, [Jeff Bezos] must be accountable for Amazons record of dishonesty before Congress, he tweeted. In light of the gravity of this situation, I am also considering whether a perjury referral is warranted. While Amazon had already been a subject of the antitrust subcommittees investigation, pressure on the company increased following the publication of a Wall Street Journal investigation into the companys use of data to compete with sellers on its marketplace. Amazon was launched as an e-commerce site where customers could buy products directly from Amazon itself, but in 2000 it began allowing third-party retailers to sell goods through the site as well. The move to running a marketplace allowed Amazon to increase the range of products offered on its site, while giving sellers access to Amazons vast customer base. In 2019, Bezos told shareholders that third-party sellers accounted for more than half (58%) of the physical gross merchandise sold on Amazon. But the situation caused unease among antitrust campaigners and advocates for fair competition, especially as Amazon moved more aggressively into selling private label goods that compete directly with marketplace sellers. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of the company, has compared Amazons position with regard to the marketplace as akin to being both the umpire and a player in the game. In July 2019, Nate Sutton, the associate general counsel for Amazon, provided sworn testimony to congress that Amazon does not use any seller data to compete with third-party sellers or to inform decisions about launching its private label brands. But more than 20 former employees of the companys private label brands told the Wall Street Journal that it was standard operating practice for Amazon employees use data about individual sellers to inform decisions about their own products. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously denied misleading Congress and has said that it is investigating the serious allegations of employee misconduct described in the Journals report.  .@RepJerryNadler Respectfully, suggestions we misled Congress are unfounded. We've been clear w/ the Committee that Amazon prohibits use of individual sellers data as WSJ alleged. As w/ any serious allegation of employee misconduct, we are investigating. https://t.co/umZ7IC6twz https://t.co/ES3XA7SwsY pic.twitter.com/R43YksTPYQ— Amazon Policy (@amazon_policy) April 24, 2020  Amazon often acts as though its above the law, said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. Today, the House judiciary committee firmly demonstrated that its not. Mitchell also testified before the House committee, at the same hearing in which Sutton made his disputed statement. Amazon doesnt just dominate markets, she said at the time. Through its control of essential infrastructure, it has assumed governing authority over a growing share of our commerce  Amazon has the power to regulate, tax, and punish Americans engaged in trade  To restore competition and safeguard our liberty, we need to both restructure and regulate Amazon.","551"
"2020-05-01T18:23:10Z","football","Football","Premier League clubs accept need to use neutral venues to finish season","The Premier Leagues clubs put on a united front during a three-and-a-half-hour video conference on Friday saying they remained determined to find a way to complete the season in the face of the Covid-19 crisis, with the use of neutral stadiums without fans now a prerequisite. But the harmony is not complete, with more than one club privately feeling the campaign ought to end because the obstacles to the hoped-for resumption in mid-June are simply too great.   Related: Adam Peaty set to be among first individual athletes to resume training   The principal concern is whether playing on would put the health of the players, club staff members and, by extension, their families at risk. The Manchester City striker Sergio Agero said on Thursday that he was scared to finish the campaign for this reason and there are other players who share that fear. The Professional Footballers Association has made it plain that the safety of the players is its overriding concern; it will not contemplate putting them in harms way and the Guardian understands some players want the union to make a stand on their behalf. On the other hand, there are many more players who do want to continue. As on so many points, consensus is difficult to achieve. The Premier League issued a lengthy statement after the conference call and one line stood out. It was agreed that the PFA, LMA, players and managers are key to this process and will be further consulted, it said. The PFA knows that what the government and Premier League want is fundamental and the government has said football should return as soon as it is safe to do so; this is partly for the lift that it would give to the population. The government on Friday began a set of meetings with sporting bodies to map a route towards resumptions. There are players and club staff members who think the resumption of the season is wishful thinking; they cannot see how the rates of infection will drop to a manageable level quickly enough but, for now, it is a waiting game until the government indicates next Thursday whether they can ease the current lockdown. The Premier League will meet again next Friday. Eight to 10 stadiums are being identified for use as neutral venues. Almost all are expected to be Premier League grounds and clubs would not play in their own stadium. The move follows advice from police but not all clubs support it. Stadiums chosen will be those granted licences by the sports grounds safety authority. That will take into account factors such as their suitability for respecting physical distancing inside the stadium, for keeping people away from the outside of the stadium and local infection rates.    Brightons Amex Stadium could potentially be used as a neutral ground as it is away from highly populated urban centres. Photograph: James Boardman/EPA   There was a preference articulated for grounds  such as Manchester Citys Etihad Stadium and Brightons Amex Stadium  which are away from highly populated urban centres. The league aims to ensure that clubs would not have to travel long distances and travel be as equally spread as possible. The conference call went into detail on proposed plans for a safe return to training and playing, including protocols around testing and creating a sterile environment for players and staff. Protocols are still being worked on for a return to full training and matches and there is an understanding the players views must be considered. On Thursday Brightons Glenn Murray described the idea of wearing face masks in training as farcical but it is understood the detail presented was well received. All 20 clubs suggested they were committed to continue with the season, with the sense among some that if a restart is not possible now then it may not be later either. Those clubs that have reservations against resumption chose not to speak out. None of the issues that have so far split clubs  from the extension of contracts to concerns over player welfare  were raised. With no vote taken on which way to proceed, pending advice from government, the key meeting passes to next week. If the League is to stick to its preferred outcome of a return to training on 18 May and matches from 8 June, however, the window for finding a way forward is narrowing.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  The League said: The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019-20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the governments support. Bobby Barnes, the PFAs deputy chief executive, said earlier in the week: We have reiterated that players are not just footballers but partners, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, who share the same health concerns as everyone else during this pandemic. We have been assured of the intentions of all that there would be no resumption unless guarantees of safety could be given to the players. The overriding principle for all parties is the healthy and safety of all participants on and off the field and, of course, the wider public.","804"

 7.16pm BST 
Evening summary


The government said it passed its 100,000 tests per day target, amid claims the tally has been artificially boosted. At the daily press briefing Matt Hancock said as of 9am today there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursdays figure of 81,611. However, the HSJ reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests to reach the target, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change.
Deprived areas have double the death rate of affluent ones, new figures from the ONS revealed. The most deprived areas registered 55.1 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 people, 118% times that in the least deprived areas where the rate was 25.3 per 100,000. London had the highest mortality rate, with the highest age-standardised mortality rates in the borough of Newham (144.3 deaths per 100,000), followed by Brent (141.5) and Hackney (127.4).
Nicola Sturgeon adopted a cautious tone warning that it was not safe to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet. This was in striking contrast with Boris Johnsons optimistic tone yesterday that the UK is past the peak. The first minister of Scotland appeared concerned at the suggestion that the worst is over, later saying, Progress is fragile and if we ease up it will be reversed. So we need to encourage maximum compliance with current restrictions.
Face coverings have a weak but positive effect in slowing the spread of the virus, the PMs spokesman told the lobby briefing. Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to wear face coverings or not, but the advice suggests they have a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from asymptomatic people where physical distancing isnt possible. The housing secretary Robert Jenrick also said this morning wearing one was a personal choice.
Ryanair announced plans for 3,000 job cuts as a direct result of the pandemic. The airline said it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June, and expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels to take at least two years.

The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has gone well past its goal of 100,000 tests a day to combat coronavirus, but faced claims that the number had been artificially inflated.
In his press briefing on Friday at 5pm, Hancock said in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursdays figure of 81,611.
I knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal, he said. I can announce that we have met our goal.
Hancock immediately hailed the outcome as an incredible achievement and vindication for his strategy of focusing on a goal that had seemed well out of the governments reach as recently as last week.
But earlier on Friday, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample.
 It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change.

The number of confirmed cases among prisons in England and Wales continues to rise, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows.
As of 5pm on Thursday, there were 345 prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19 across 73 prisons, a rise of 1% in 24 hours, while the number of infected prison staff rose 2% in the same period to 371 in 64 prisons. 
A Public Health England paper published earlier this week said there was cause for cautious optimism across the prison estate as deaths and cases were lower than expected. 
But the same paper warned that some of the measures currently in place would have to continue until April next year.

Q. A Nursing Times survey indicates nurses are feeling more anxious at work and their mental health is suffering, what will be done about this in the long-term to retain nurses?
Hancock says nurses have shown great bravery during the pandemic.
He says increasing the number of nurses is an important part of the plan. 
Q. Have BAME nursing staff been put at greater risk?
Powis says they recognise the disproportionate effect the virus is having on BAME staff.
Work is being done to understand why this is, he says.
Newton says the virus is present in different ways in different parts of the country, which are comprised of people from different backgrounds.
The underlying risks need to be identified and understood, he says.
Some ethnic groups have different risks of underlying conditions, he adds.
PHE and universities are looking at this, and feeding back to NHS England, he says.
Powis adds this data isnt needed to provide support and specialist assistance is being offered. Local healthcare leaders are being told to do whats necessary to protect BME workers.
And thats it, the press conference has ended.

Q. The impact in Northern Ireland has been lower than in the rest of the UK. Is there any merit in eventually easing restrictions here at a different pace?
Hancock says the virus has affected different regions differently but the fall has been basically the same throughout the country.
Moving together was the right approach, he says.
He says he sees the case that could be made for lifting restrictions at a different pace.
Q. Would it be better for Stormont to work on an all-Ireland basis to fight the pandemic rather than following the UK lead?
Hancock says the relationship with the Republic of Ireland is important but the relationship is intensive within the UK.



 5.58pm BST 

Q. Can you reassure over-70s they will treated the same as the rest of the population when lockdown is over?
Hancock says it was clear from the start that specific groups need to shield.
Powis adds that the over-70s can be fit and healthy, not everybody at that age has a chronic health condition or underlying disease.
A group of individuals, some of whom are in that age bracket, needed to shield because underlying conditions put them more at risk, he says.
Everybody is being asked to stay at home so were all in the same boat in that sense, he adds.
As the infection rate comes under control going forward, this will be under consideration.
Q. Is late summer a realistic timescale for people to be able to make plans to meet up with friends and family or go on holiday?
Hancock says its tempting to speculate on this but its still too early to say, we just dont know, he says.
The five tests are there partly to give people a sense of when we can make those next decisions, he says.
Well only lift lockdown measures when its safe to do so, he says. As of today, its too soon to say.



 5.53pm BST 
No change to how tests are counted, says Prof Newton

Q. A report in the HSJ says tests are now being counted once posted out rather than once the sample has been processed, is that true?
Newton says there has been no change to the way tests are counted. 
With new ways of delivering tests, officials have given advice on how they should be counted, he says.
The majority are counted in labs, but for any test which takes place outside the programme theyre counted when they leave the programme, he says. So tests that are mailed out or go out by satellite, have always been counted that way.

Thats the way they are counted, have always been counted and were advised to count them by officials.

Q. Whats your reaction to the report that youre twice as likely to die from Covid-19 if you live in a deprived part of the country, what policy implications does that have?
Hancock says this is something were worried about and looking at.
It has a bigger impact on older people, men, people from BME backgrounds, people who are obese, and new evidence from the ONS suggests there is a correlation with deprivation  these are all being looked at, he says.

Updated at 5.58pm BST


 5.48pm BST 

Q. The daily testing figure is a massive increase in a short period of time. How many of those are home testing kits that were mailed out yesterday but havent actually been yet returned and analysed by labs? 
Newton says the NHS and PHE labs across the four nations have done 39,753 tests between them. A partnership with Roche undertook 13,723 tests.
The tests undertaken by the new Lighthouse labs total 79,522, he says. These include drive-through, mobile units and research nurses for the ONS.
There were 27,497 home kits delivered, and 12,782 delivered through the satellite process. Under the surveillance tests (antibody testing) there were 3,072 undertaken.
That makes up the breakdown of todays testing figure, he says.
Q. How much weight do you put on a South Korean study that suggests you cannot get the virus a second time?
Newton says the science on immunity is still emerging and not precise.
You would never make a decision based on a single study, he says. These results would need to be replicated elsewhere, but it is surely promising and encouraging, he adds.
Q. Was a Public Health England official wrong to suggest that children dont seem able to transmit the disease?
Powis says if a child is symptomatic, theres no reason to think they wont transmit like anyone else.
The question is for children who dont have any symptoms who get the virus, he says.
How transmissible the virus is in these cases is a key question were still learning about, the evidence is still emerging, he says.
Newton says this is his understanding also.



 5.39pm BST 

Q. Can you ensure that health and care workers get priority so they can get tested?
Hancock says yes, either through the NHS itself or through the employer route which will give them priority for getting a drive-through slot.
Once we have contact tracing in place on a large-scale, we need to test them as soon as possible so they can isolate and not pass on the disease, he adds.
This is a new priority for testing, once its up and running by the middle of the month, he says.



 5.37pm BST 

They are taking questions from the media now.
Q. How do you intend to further develop and extend the testing network?
Hancock says very soon we should get the results of surveys to show how many people have the disease across the country.
A new lab is coming on stream next week in Cambridge, he says.
Capacity needs to focus on care homes to tackle the epidemic there, he says.
Newton says the work of the new labs must integrate with the existing structures to help use the new capacity to maximum benefit, e.g. getting results back to GPs, he says.
The rollout of home testing will be useful for contact tracing and rapid, he adds.



 5.34pm BST 

Stuart from Redditch asks if the Nightingale hospitals will be used going forward to help reduce NHS waiting lists as we come through the pandemic?
Hancock says the Nightingales were designed specifically for patients with Covid-19.
Powis adds they were created to provide extra capacity for ventilated patients. They are designed in a particular way for a particular purpose, so they wouldnt necessarily be appropriate for other uses, he says.
They are also there as an insurance policy, he says.



 5.31pm BST 

They are taking questions from members of the public now.
Andrew from Leeds asks if there will be fines if people choose to keep their children off school once the lockdown is lifted and schools have reopened. How will the government make sure the public is confident its safe?
Hancock says when it is safe to do so, the government will make recommendations on this. Were not going to reopen schools if it isnt safe, he says.
This disease doesnt appear to give children symptoms nearly as bad as adults, he says. 
Powis says the virus affects children much less than adults and the elderly. There have been rare reports about complications in children, which are being looked at, he says.
The science is still evolving about transmission in children, but the key thing is the disease is not serious for the vast majority of younger people, he says.
Hancock says the decision to close schools was down to the impact of schools on transmission, not on the safety of children, he says.



 5.26pm BST 

Powis says most people are avoiding contact with vulnerable people, including 84% of adults have only left their for permitted reasons or not left their home.
More people (45%) are working from home since the measures were introduced, he says. 
The number of tests have increased dramatically in the last few days, he says.
The number of new cases as determined by positive tests have increased in recent days. This should be seen in the context of more testing, he says.
Overall, the number is relatively stable, he says, which reflects the number of infections is falling.
Hospital admissions have been falling, particularly in London. Its moving down in other regions too more slowly, but overall the trend is downwards.
The number of people in critical care is falling in the four nations, he says.
Deaths in all settings is overall showing a downward trend.



 5.22pm BST 

Prof Powis is going through the slides now.
The transmission rate, the reproduction rate, the number of new infections is falling, keeping pressure off the NHS, he says.
The five tests for adjusting the lockdown are:

the NHS continues to have sufficient capacity 
sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths
reliable data to show rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board
PPE and other factors including testing must be in hand with supply to meet future demand
a second peak must be avoided as it runs a risk of overwhelming the NHS




 5.19pm BST 

Prof Newton is speaking now.
The decision to enter lockdown was not linked to the lack of tests, he says. Access to limitless testing, even if we had had it, would not have made a difference, he says. 
The decision to enter lockdown would have been the same, and at the same time, he says.
We can relax social distancing only when the five tests are met, he says. That means getting the infection rate right down.
We now have a flexible and substantial testing capability in the UK, he says, to tell us how the virus is spreading across the country.
The new NHS app is making rapid progress. He encourages people to sign up.

In a race to meet the governments target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by this evenings deadline, hospitals appear to have ramped up testing.
A reader has been in touch to report a sudden surge in the number of samples arriving for analysis at the laboratory for Great Ormond Street childrens hospital.Demand for tests had been surprisingly low until this week, and staffing was more than halved as a consequence. On Sunday 18 April, the lab apparently received no samples at all.However, since Wednesday the situation has reversed, with technicians now processing as many as 600 samples a day.The Guardian understands that all patients and staff, whether they have Covid-19 symptoms or not, have been encouraged to take the test, along with the families and carers of patients. This follows guidance from NHS England asking hospitals to expand testing to all non-elective (serious and emergency) patients from Monday this week.Testing has apparently included children being shielded from infection on isolation wards. The procedure involves inserting a q-tip shaped swab into the nose, and another into the throat - an uncomfortable experience even for adults.A spokesperson for the hospital said: 

In line with national guidance we are testing all non-elective in-patients for Covid-19. Where possible we are taking the additional step of testing the parents and carers who accompany them.

The Premier Leagues 20 clubs outlined at a meeting on Friday their determination to complete the season amid the pandemic.
Although no decisions were taken on the next steps, the participants are understood to have been pleased with the progress made.
A lengthy meeting included plenty of discussion about logistics, including how to lock down grounds and create safe environments, the possibility of playing matches at neutral venues, and protocols around testing, including the regularity with which those should be done.
In a statement the league said: 

The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019-20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the governments support.

NHS staff from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds may be given roles away from the frontline under plans to reduce their disproportionately high death rate from Covid-19.
The Guardian revealed last week that minority groups were over-represented by as much as 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll. Additionally, 63% of the first 106 health and social care staff known to have died from the virus were black or Asian, according to the Health Service Journal.
In this explainer, my colleague Haroon Siddique looks at the figures and explains why BAME people may be more at risk.

Care workers in Wales will each receive a 500 bonus to reflect their value during the pandemic, the first minister has announced.
Mark Drakeford said the payments would be made to around 64,000 care home workers and domiciliary care workers who provide the scaffolding of services across the country.
He told the Welsh governments daily Covid-19 briefing on Friday: 

This payment is designed to provide some further recognition of the value we attach to everything they are doing.
This group of people, usually women, often not well paid, are providing the invisible scaffolding of services which support both our NHS and our wider society.
Without this small army of people, large numbers of others would not be able to continue to live independently at home, or receive everyday support with basic needs by living in a residential care home.

Drakeford noted some of the social care workforce were among the lowest paid in Wales, and that the picture contrasted with the Welsh NHS where there are pay bands, and salaries meet or exceed the living wage.
He also called on the UK government to waive tax and national insurance deductions from the one-off payment, on the basis the country was experiencing exceptional circumstances.
Local authorities are expected to administer the payments but no date was given as to when they will be made.

More than two-thirds of Londons pavements are not wide enough to allow people to follow physical distancing advice to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission, according to new research.
Only 36% of pavements in Greater London are at least 3 metres wide, allowing pedestrians to meet the governments advice for people to stay at least 2 metres apart when outdoors, found researchers from University College London.

There are also broad variations of the proportion of pavements wide enough to allow physical distancing in different London boroughs, according to the Streets research group, which includes academics from UCLs Bartlett school of architecture. 
The City of London has the highest percentage (51%) of streets that meet the minimum requirement, while Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames and Newham and Haringey all have the lowest (between 26-28%), according to their analysis. 
Dr Ashley Dhanani, a member of the project team and a research associate at the Bartletts Space Syntax Laboratory, said: 

While some may opt to walk in the road, this is not possible for people with pushchairs or with mobility impairments. Our research shows that there is an urgent need to reallocate street space in London so everyone can use streets safely.

You can download a map of London that shows all the streets where there are at least six metres of non-road space here. These are the streets that have enough space on either side for pedestrians to stay 2 metres apart.

Another 352 deaths in England, bringing total to 20,483

NHS England has announced 352 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,483.
The 352 patients were aged between 30 and 103 years old, and 18 of them (aged between 43 and 98 years old) had no known underlying health condition.
Of the 352 new hospital deaths announced today by NHS England:- 70 occurred on 30 April- 148 occurred on 29 April - 39 occurred on 28 April 
The figures also show 70 of the new deaths took place between 1-27 April, while the remaining 25 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 16 March.
NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks earlier. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated.
Todays figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 863.

Researchers are to launch a new trial of a Japanese-manufactured drug they believe could be a promising treatment for Covid-19.
A total of 450 hospital inpatients with mild to moderate symptoms of the disease will be recruited to take part in the study in the UK.
The randomised control trial will see some receive favipiravir, an anti-viral drug produced by Fujifilm Toyama Chemicals in Japan. 
Other patients will received a combination treatment of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin, while a third group will be given existing standard care for Covid-19.Chelsea and Westminster hospital and West Middlesex university hospital in London are participating in the trial, which also involves Imperial College and the Royal Brompton hospital.
University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium aims to start a trial on up to 200 patients at a later date.
Pallav Shah, a professor in respiratory medicine at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and the studys chief investigator, said the study will target early cases of Covid-19 in the hope of finding a treatment which prevents patients progressing into intensive care, reduces the length of their hospital stay and limits their infectiousness.
Patients with symptoms such as breathlessness and a fever will be approached to take part in the study before swab results even come back to ensure treatment can be given early.

McDonalds is to reopen a number of UK restaurants for delivery from 13 May after closing all of its sites due to the coronavirus lockdown.
The locations of the 15 restaurants will be announced next week. 
The fast food chain has spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites, PA reports.

Paul Pomroy, the chains boss for the UK and Ireland, said the tests were successful, after the company said it had incorporated feedback from staff after the tests and worked closely with the government and trade bodies regarding its reopening plans.
All restaurants will be deep cleaned prior to reopening, with new safety measures such as perspex screens, floor markings and smaller teams. The chain will also serve a limited menu and will not be serving breakfast.
Staff will also receive protective equipment, such as non-medical-grade face masks, and have their temperatures taken with contactless thermometers before shifts. Social distancing measures will be introduced for all delivery and service partners including Uber Eats and Just Eat.
Pomroy added: 

Slowly, but safely, we will return to towns and cities across the UK and Ireland and thank you for your continued support as we work through this crisis.

The general public should turn to reusable face masks, not single-use surgical masks, if face coverings become part of the UKs exit strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have said in a new report, revealing the move would save 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste.
At a press conference yesterday, Boris Johnson said face masks could be useful as part of the UKs exit strategy, suggesting they may help people have confidence in returning to work.
However expert advice on the use of face masks among the general public has been mixed. It is understood the UKs Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has advised the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection  a stance similar to that of the World Health Organization and others who say there is little evidence they reduce the risk of a wearer becoming infected. Concerns have also been raised that any recommendation for the public to use face masks could lead to shortages of surgical masks among health and social care workers.
But some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the precautionary principle, adding these can be homemade since cloth masks are better than no covering in reducing the amount of droplets sprayed from peoples mouths.
Now the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub at University College London has issued a report revealing that cloth masks would save vast quantities of plastic, and that washing them means they can be re-used.
If every person in the UK used one disposable surgical mask each day for a year, this would create over 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste (66,000 tonnes of contaminated waste and 57,000 tonnes of plastic packaging), the report notes, adding that while contaminated waste from medical settings is collected and incinerated, no such facilities operate for the public which could result in public health problems.
The report also reveals how the team carried out a careful analysis to explore the scenario with the lowest environmental impact, noting machine washing masks, used in rotation, is preferable to hand-washing, which is an inefficient way to clean them.
Wed recommend that people have four and that they use one a day, [then] they put that one straight in the washing basket and they wash it with their other [laundry], said materials scientist Prof Mark Miodownik who led the work, adding that he welcomed the local manufacture of such cloth masks.
In addition, the report contains advice on how a public campaign could be rolled out, noting it is important the public know how to put on and take off such masks, and that the use of masks doesnt lead people to becoming complacent.
Single-use PPE undoubtedly has its place, particularly as an immediate measure to protect those at the greatest risk of infection, the authors add. However, any wide-scale public policies that are implemented during this crisis will have serious long-term ramifications, not only for public health but the health of the natural environment.

Government changes how it counts test to hit 100,000 target, report says

The government has changed the way it is counting the number of Covid-19 tests carried out, in a bid to hit its self-imposed 100,000 tests per day target, the Health Service Journal reports.
Previously, a test would be counted once the sample had been processed in a lab, but this definition has been changed in the last few days, a senior source has told the HSJ.
According to the source, the Department of Health and Social Care is now including tests that have been posted or delivered to peoples homes in its figures  which means tests that are sent to people are counted before the recipient has done their test and returned their sample to the lab.
The HSJ understands that up to 50,000 of the tests that will be reported as having taken place on 30 April will actually represent the mailing of, or the agreeing to the mailing of, a home testing kit.

British Airways parent company has signed agreements for 1bn (900m) of loans backed by the Spanish government, but the money cannot be used to help its UK airline, which is cutting up to 12,000 jobs, PA reports.
IAG said the money could be used to help its Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. There are restrictions on the upstream of cash to the rest of the IAG companies, the firm added.
IAG has not requested a loan from the UK government. It announced this week that up to 12,000 jobs would be lost at BA, representing more than a quarter of its workforce.
On Thursday it emerged that the airline may not resume operations at Gatwick, the UKs second busiest airport.
In a letter to staff, the BA chief executive, Alex Cruz, wrote:

There is no government bailout standing by for BA.

Pilots union Balpa has vowed it will fight to save every pilot job at BA.

Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, national mental health director for NHS England, confirmed the NHS is planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. She said: 

We know its been a high stress environment. Were planning mental health support right now.

She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. The military are very good at this, she said. 
Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as Samaritans, had been set up to support staff.
Responding to MPs questions, Murdoch also said that there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm:

We absolutely have not seen that. Were pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyones more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less.

The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern: 

Early detection is vital for survival.

She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. 

There have been no national instructions on screening. Its important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on.

It is easy to see why it could be thrilling fiction for our times: it has a mysterious and fatal virus, an epidemiologist hero, a desperate search for a vaccine and murky political skulduggery. It also features a green monkey.
But whether it is the moment for Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question.
Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson Srs 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as a tireless self-promoter.

At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon was probed about overnight briefings suggesting that Boris Johnsons optimistic tone yesterday was putting at risk her own message that progress remains very fragile and could easily be reversed if people relax their adherence to lockdown guidelines.
The first minister said she was not convinced there is a huge substantive difference between what she and the prime minister were saying, adding that she was choosing to use my own words. 
Insisting that she did not want to diminish positive messages from the downward trend in hospital and intensive care admissions, she reiterated it is too early to say that the light is not going to be extinguished.
She also warned: If we are premature in these decisions and the virus runs away from us ... it will do even more damage to the economy.
Announcing the increase in testing capacity and eligibility, Sturgeon also underlined this should not be an exercise in driving up the numbers.
Sturgeon warned the tests can be unpleasant and invasive, especially for frail older people, adding: Yes, volumes are important ... but these must be clinically-driven decisions. She said the focus on capacity and objectives of testing was more important than the numbers.

A recent survey for Ipsos Mori suggested that more than 60% of Britons would feel uncomfortable carrying out their usual activities  such as going to bars or restaurants, or using public transport  if the lockdown was eased.
It suggests the public is nervous about a quick return to normality, with 61% saying they would feel uncomfortable using public transport or going to bars and restaurants.
Young people are most at ease with going to bars and restaurants. Thirty-six per cent of 18-34-year olds would feel comfortable doing so, compared with only 22% of 55-75s.

Budget airline Wizz Air will resume some flights from Luton airport on Friday with passengers and crew required to wear face masks.
The Hungarian carrier will introduce the new hygiene measures when it reopens its base at the airport, including the wearing of face masks, physical distancing between passengers during boarding and an enhanced cleaning regime.
Flights are due to operate to Budapest, Lisbon and Sofia on Friday. Other routes, such as Tenerife and Tel Aviv, will resume in the coming weeks, pending travel restrictions.
UK lockdown restrictions prevent Britons from being allowed to travel to airports for a holiday. But people are able to fly for other reasons, such as to return home after being stranded overseas or if they are travelling for work.
Customers are also being urged to use online services for checking in and making purchases such as additional bags to reduce non-essential interaction at the airport, and to use contactless payment methods if they buy anything while on flights.

'Face coverings have 'weak but positive effect' in slowing spread - lobby briefing key points

Here are the main takeaways from this afternoons Downing Street briefing:
Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to use face coverings, the prime ministers spokesman has insisted at the daily lobby briefing. Boris Johnson told yesterdays press conference:

I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.

But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken: 

Ministers are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice.
The advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from ... asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible.

And he suggested the prime minister was not referring to medical masks. 

Were talking about face covering. Were certainly not thinking about anything that might take PPE supplies away from the NHS, or care workers, or others.

With the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, expected to host this evenings daily press conference, the PMs spokesman did not reveal whether the 100,000-a-day testing target had been met. But he said: 

The health secretarys target has been very effective in driving up capacity in the system. Capacity is whats really important.

He confirmed that 81,611 tests had taken place in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday.
The spokesman also didnt rule out government support for ailing airlines:

Weve been clear were prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort.

Although, he also pointed out the firms are eligible for many of the governments other business support measures.

Further 40 deaths in Scotland, taking total to 1,515

Nicola Sturgeon has started her daily briefing by confirming 11,654 positive cases of coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of 301 from the day before. 
There are now 1,809 patients in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, an increase of 61 from the previous day; of these patients, 110 are in intensive care. 
The first minister also said that 2,659 patients who had the virus had left hospital since 5 March. 
In the last 24 hours there were a further 40 deaths registered of patients who had a positive test for the virus, taking that daily total to 1,515. 
Sturgeon also set out a chunk of detail on testing, as promised. Active lab capacity in NHS Scotland is now at 4,350 tests a week, and added to the UKs Lighthouse lab in Glasgow this means that the country now has the capacity for 8,350 tests a day.
In terms of actual tests carried out, a total of 4,661 were carried out yesterday, a combination of 2,537 NHS tests and 2,124 from the UK governments regional drive-through centres.
She also announced a significant expansion in eligibility for testing  all residents and staff in care homes with cases will now be tested. There will also be sample testing in other care homes, access to drive-through centres for the over-65s and those few workers who have to leave home for work but arent already eligible.

Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart.
The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports, and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrances to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission.
Passenger numbers at the UKs largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures.
He said while forward bookings implied there was still massive demand for travel, it was vital to plan ahead.

Care home boss blasts Johnson's claim that pandemic is on downward slope

One of the UKs largest providers of care homes, which has lost more than 300 residents to Covid-19, has responded angrily to Boris Johnsons claim the pandemic is on a downward slope, saying this is not true in care homes and lambasting the newly announced testing regime as completely shambolic.MHA, which has 222 facilities, said the prime minister was being at best disingenuous when he told the Downing Street press briefing the UK had come through the peak and there was sunlight ahead.
Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of the network, said:

We are now 43 days in from lockdown, yet still our residents and staff have not received the enhanced level of protection that they need. The government will be held to account for this. 

Confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths in care homes have been running at around 2,400 a week, according to official figures published on Tuesday.

 Related: Care home fatalities to be included in daily coronavirus death tolls 

Monaghan said that despite nursing dementia homes being by far the worst hit by the virus no consideration has been given to prioritising tests for those settings, nor the suitability of administering tests to our residents.

This cannot surely be beyond the ability of our policymakers, scientists and government. We said weeks ago that we were being treated as the poor relations to the NHS and the situation, despite our protestations, has not improved.

On Tuesday, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the rollout of testing of all residents and staff in care homes in England, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, insisting the spread of the virus though care homes is absolutely a top priority.But Monaghan said that while the long-called-for policy was laudable, in practice it remains completely shambolic, with many staff and residents unable to secure tests, inconsistencies between the nations, leaving homes unable to effectively control the virus.

We cannot and will not accept assumptions that higher rates of death in care homes is somehow inevitable. With the right support, it isnt.

Lords to form Covid-19 committee to scrutinise government's response to pandemic

Peers have announced plans to form a Covid-19 committee to scrutinise the governments response to the pandemic.
A report by the Lords liaison committee recommended the new Covid-19 committee should undertake cross-cutting scrutiny of the governments response, developing understanding of the lessons learned and how they can be applied in the future.

 Related: 10 key lessons for the future to be learned from fighting Covid-19 

The recommendation to establish the new committee will be put to a motion for agreement in the House of Lords. Members will then be appointed to the committee in the coming weeks.
Lord McFall of Alcluith, the senior deputy speaker of the House of Lords, said: 

This is the first time either house has sought to establish a new committee dedicated to the Covid-19 emergency and the governments response to it.
Two key strengths of Lords committees are their cross-cutting nature, they are thematic in approach rather than set up to shadow government departments, and the real world experience our members can bring to them.
These strengths will be much in evidence in the new Covid-19 committee which will be made up of experts across a whole range of relevant professional backgrounds and be free to consider all the aspects and impact of the current crisis, including on the economy, education and the social bonds between generations.
I firmly believe the new committee will have a key role to play in ensuring we learn the right lessons from the crisis and understand to the fullest extent its effects upon our society, economy and way of life.

High-risk pregnancies may be missed during the coronavirus pandemic because expectant mothers are too scared to pick up the phone to their midwife, according to Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM).
Anxiety in the pregnant population is becoming more pronounced during the Covid-19 outbreak, a committee was told, with an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services.
Walton told MPs she was concerned this may be a factor which could lead to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths.
She told the Commons health and social care committee messaging is key in ensuring women come forward if they need help: 

Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned.
I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible.
I do think its really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible.

RCM members have reported many patients becoming more anxious during the pandemic, she added, emphasising the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance.
Walton also said she was concerned about the apparent disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME staff and pregnant women.
She said expectant mothers from BAME backgrounds should be treated as more vulnerable than the general population and midwives are aware of that.

Home births have faced the biggest impact from the pandemic, she said, with services disrupted due to reasons including staffing issues and paramedic ambulance capacity.
She said returning to home births would require risk assessments, the return of staffing and testing of women in the community who want to have a baby at home.

Public health campaigners are calling on the Scottish government to keep focus on managing Scotlands problematic relationship with alcohol, on the second anniversary of the introduction of minimum unit pricing.
Minimum unit pricing (MUP) came into force in Scotland on 1 May 2018, in an attempt to cut the countrys higher-than average alcohol consumption and high death rates from alcohol-related diseases, and bars retailers from selling alcoholic drinks, including beers, wines, spirits and ciders, at less than 50p per unit of alcohol. 
Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said, The initial results from the evaluation of minimum unit pricing are hugely encouraging as studies have found a significant decrease in consumption in the first year compared to England and Wales. However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotlands unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.
Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible relaxation of alcohol licensing restrictions during the lockdown, as elderly shoppers and others take advantage of early supermarket opening.

The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers nosedived to a seven-year low in March. The sharp deterioration happened amid signs that households are running a tight ship by making large repayments on other types of borrowing such as credit cards. 
Figures from the Bank of England show that 56,161 mortgages were approved for house purchase in March. 
This was a drop-off of nearly a quarter (24%) compared with the previous month, and the lowest monthly total since 54,341 approvals were recorded in March 2013. 
The pause button has been pushed on the housing market as people and businesses adhere to lockdown measures imposed on March 23 to limit the spread of coronavirus.

Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said chemotherapy treatments were running at 70% of normal levels but two-week referrals were down by 62%. She told MPs at the health and social care committee: Broadly, chemotherapy appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19. She added: We had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly its very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival. When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: I dont think thats the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. 
Its really important to state that urgent referrals and urgent cancer treatments are continuing  obviously we need to tailor that to patients individual risk but I think it would be wrong to make a mathematical calculation on that basis. Its very important that we get people coming forward but I think to translate that into missed diagnosis and poor survival would not be a responsible position at this point.

Flights between Britain and Northern Ireland will continue to operate through 5.7m of taxpayer funding, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced. The package is being funded by the UK government and the Northern Ireland executive to ensure airports and airlines do not axe lifeline services because of the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Aer Lingus and Loganair will be subsidised to maintain London flights to and from Belfast City airport and City of Derry airport respectively. The Northern Irish airports involved will also be given funding to provide ground services for the flights. The Belfast-London route would be at risk without financial assistance given low passenger numbers, the Department for Transport stated. Shapps said: Maintaining air links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is vital. We must ensure that critical workers can continue to fly over the Irish Sea and todays investment in these lifeline services guarantees that.

When asked about the provision of mental health care for pregnant women, Walton said members of the Royal College of Midwives had reported many patients had become more anxious during the pandemic. She said: A lot of women get anxious during pregnancy anyway and I think the pathways for advice and referrals have got better over recent years. During the pandemic, women have become even more anxious because pregnant women are a vulnerable group, so there has been an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services, we know that. What we are trying to do is bring some of that support and care back to the midwife. Every woman has a midwife, midwives have training in supporting women who have anxiety and apprehension, and the ability to refer onwards if they believe a wider mental health team would be of assistance. Walton emphasised the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance.

She added: One of the positives from the pandemic is the use of technology, so there has been more virtual contact and follow-up with women through midwives and maternity services than before.

Deprived areas have double death rates of affluent

Residents in deprived areas have experienced double the death rates of those in affluent areas, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal.Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas. The most deprived area had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people, more than double (118%) that in the least deprived areas, where the rate was 25.3 deaths.London had the highest mortality rate, with 85.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The highest age-standardised mortality rate was in the London borough of Newham, with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent, with 141.5 deaths per 100,000 population, and Hackney, 127.4 deaths per 100,000 population.

An online festival is being organised by the UKs specialist cheese community to urge the public to support small cheesemakers during the Covid-19 lockdown. 
The event will take place on the early May bank holiday and is being organised by the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA), the Academy of Cheese, the Guild of Fine Food and cheese writer Patrick McGuigan.
It invites cheese lovers to stock up on artisan cheese in the lead-up to the festival to raise awareness of the crisis that threatens to wipe out the previously thriving speciality cheese industry. The festival will be free and educational, organisers said.
Tracey Colley, director of the Academy of Cheese, commented: We are absolutely thrilled to see how many experts from across our industry have wanted to take part in the British Cheese Weekender. From cheesemakers to cheese distributors we now have a multitude of virtual cheese events for everyone to join in with. The Academy of Cheese community of over 2,000 members are busy planning where to buy cheese for the weekend and with so many fantastic artisan cheeses now available for direct delivery they are very excited.

David Nabarro, the World Health Organizations special envoy on Covid-19, said it would be perfectly reasonable for the UK to start easing the lockdown before a full contact tracing system was up and running. Speaking to BBC Radio 4s Today programme, he said: Every government is having to make a choice and I understand that the contact tracing process is now well advanced and so thats a reasonable time to be thinking through how lockdown can be eased, and it wont be eased all at once, it will be eased bit by bit. He added: You dont need to have 100% contact tracing in order to get the R number down. The contact tracing is an absolutely essential part of reducing transmission, and getting that capacity as widely spread as possible is key to getting the transmission as low as you can. But you certainly can release the lockdown while youre building up the case-finding and contact-tracing capacity - thats what most other countries are doing.

Leaders of the UK town predicted to suffer the biggest economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic have issued an urgent plea for help from the government. More than 50% of jobs in Crawley are at risk of being lost or furloughed, according to a recent report. There are fears that the West Sussex town, located close to Gatwick airport, could experience an employment catastrophe as the economy most affected by the Covid-19 lockdown. The leader of the borough council and the towns MP have called on the government to take rapid action and ensure that Crawleys amazing economic success, built up over many decades, is not lost in a matter of weeks. The letter states: It is quite clear that the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the national economy and indeed the world economy is unprecedented. However, due to the business sectors located within the town, and the proportion of local jobs and economic output from these sectors, Crawley is undeniably being hit far harder than any other part of the United Kingdom.

Heathrows chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has described social distancing at airports as impossible. He told the PA Media agency: Social distancing does not work in any form of public transport, let alone aviation. The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. If youve ever been on holiday from Gatwick, you cannot imagine going through there and socially distancing in the summer. Its just physically impossible to socially distance with any volume of passengers in an airport. The same applies with trains and tube stations. So we need a better solution, which means that in a few months time, when the disease is under control and with a low risk of infection, we can make it as low risk as possible for people to fly.

After the striking difference in tone yesterday between Boris Johnsons past the peak optimism and Nicola Sturgeons far more cautious warnings that it is not safe to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet, there are reports this morning of concerns within the Scottish government that Johnson risks jeopardising progress by suggesting that the worst is over. 
Scottish government sources have likewise raised doubt about an apparent shift in UK strategy after the wording of one of the five tests was tweaked to remove references to a second peak. While the UK government has denied that this was a meaningful change, Sturgeon said at her press conference yesterday that she was still trying to ascertain whether it was a significant shift, and that it was not one she agreed with, stating that while not overwhelming the NHS was a critical and necessary objective, I dont think it is a sufficient objective.
Expect more questions on this at the first ministers briefing this lunchtime, when she has also promised to give a substantial update on testing in Scotland.

More than 13 million people have already been unable to pay, or expect to be unable to pay, at least one bill because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to research.
Of these, almost 11 million have missed or expect to miss a bill that would leave them vulnerable to severe consequences  including eviction, bailiff enforcement or disconnection  when Covid-19 financial protections end.
Some sectors, including energy, water and mortgages, have established frameworks for helping people out of debt in a sustainable way. Others, including the private rented sector and local authorities, do not.
According to its research, commissioned by Citizens Advice and conducted by Opinium among 2,016 nationally representative UK adults, those most at risk of severe consequences include 2.6 million private renters who have missed a rent payment already or expect to do so owing to coronavirus.

A summary of the latest developments


This morning the Commons Health Committee will hear evidence on core NHS and care services. There will later be a World Health Organisation briefing on Covid-19 and the usual 5pm (GMT) Downing Street press conference. Briefing in Wales and Scotland expected are expected at 12.30 pm (GMT).
Britain has passed the peak of coronavirus infections, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday. He said that the government will set out a road map for easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions next week.
Coronavirus fatalities among black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high  and some are also bearing the economic brunt of the lockdown, a study has found. Stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities.
Victims of domestic abuse will be able to seek help in Boots pharmacies in a bid to make it easier for them to access support during the coronavirus lockdown. 
The coronavirus crisis has sparked a huge increase in people using food banks for essential supplies, according to charities. The Trussell Trust, the UKs biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume.
Care homes will be the epicentres of transmission for coronavirus spreading back into society, according to a report quoting a senior NHS England director.
Disabled people are struggling to get supermarket delivery slots and are being judged or challenged when they go out to buy food, according to a charity. 
The government is being urged to deliver pay rises and better conditions for the millions of people who are working through the Covid-19 crisis.
Britains manufacturers have suffered a collapse in demand because of the impact of the global lockdown amid warnings that conditions are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal for some time, a new survey suggests.
Ryanair has said it expects up to 3,000 jobs to be lost as part of a restructuring of the airline.

Jenrick later told BBC Breakfast that the number of tests carried out were just a stepping stone to more and that the foundations were in place for a strong national testing network. 
Weve got labs across the country producing the equipment at pace and were beginning to test essential workers, he said, adding that local government workers could now also apply for tests.

Some insights from across the globe

 The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 232,817, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The US has the highest number of deaths with at least 63,763, followed by Italy with 27,967.
 Germany is to reopen museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds, and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. This will take place under strict conditions. 
 Brazil reported a record 7,218 confirmed new cases of coronavirus, raising the total to 85,380. The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, the health ministry said. There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has previously attacked what he termed the hysteria over Covid-19.
 The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government, in the countrys highest-profile case of the disease yet.

Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought government testing for coronavirus will have been a success even if the target of 100,000 tests is not met later today. I think we will either have met it or be very close, and in that sense the target will have succeeded because it will have galvanised people across government, in the private sector and across the country, he told Sky News on Friday. This in itself is just a stepping stone, we need to go beyond 100,000, but we have seen now a very substantial increase in testing in quite a short period of time, so in that sense its been a success, but theres more to be done.
He said that the country now needed to build some head room between the rate of infection (R) and one before lockdown measures could be eased. The R [value] is still below one but we need to build some head room, there isnt an exact figure as to where the R is - its somewhere, the chief medical officer tells us, between 0.6 and 0.9, he said. We want to bring R down further than it is today and that matters so that the NHS has sufficient capacity, so that when we do start to ease the lockdown, theres some space, some room, for manoeuvre. He added that the government approach was a cautious easing over time so that such headroom for the NHS could be maintained and protected.

The statistician Sir David John Spiegelhalter warned against taking a Eurovision approach and making naive comparisons between the UKs and other countries Covid-19 deaths. 
Speaking to the BBCs Today programme, the Cambridge University professor said: 

I think its too early to tell our exact place in the league table. My article was arguing against this almost Eurovision approach of trying to say whos top, whos second and so on. Its just not appropriate to do at all. 
There are so many variabilities about how people record Covid deaths - even what the correct metric is for measuring the impact of the epidemic - that to start saying were going to be worse or whatever is completely inappropriate. 

On the governments advice, Spiegelhalter said: Its much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. 

Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful.

Jeremy Hunt said that the coronavirus outbreak has showed the importance of the social care sector and the need for funding.
Speaking on the BBC Today programme and, the chair of the health and social care select committee said: 

If there is one thing this terrible crisis has brought home to us it is importance of the social care sector  and the crucial work done by those who care for them. They put lives at risk as NHS workers do, and often for low pay. So I will be asking for proper settlement for the social care sector... and the government will want to do that.

He said that testing in the community, as has been done in South Korea, will be key. That is what they did in South Korea so they could stop the virus in its track. Its locking down the people who might have the virus but not locking down the whole economy.
Hunt said that contract tracing would need to be done through a combined method of technology and also people going door to door. He added that there would be a time when the government would need to change its messaging from stay at home to encourage people back out, but to date their approach has worked.

Ryanair plans 3,000 job cuts

Ryanair announced the planned job cuts as it revealed it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June. It said in a statement: 

As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, until summer 2022 at the earliest. 
The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss programme, which will commence from July 2020. 
These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair Airlines and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. 
Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office and back office teams. Group CEO Michael OLeary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend this 50% pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021.

Wales leader calls for four-nation approach to end lockdown

Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford has said he does not think certain parts of the UK should come out of lockdown before others. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4s Today programme, the Labour politician said: 

I agree with the prime minister, I am in favour of a four-nation approach. 
We went into lockdown together on the same terms, on the same day. Id like to see us come out of lockdown on the same basis. 
But we will use the powers we have to fine-tune the arrangements to make them right for Wales.

He added:

As we move to open up things again, we will be careful and cautious, we will have to take people with us.
Our efforts over the last week have been directed at working with our trade unions, our local authorities and other stakeholders because you can open up anything you like, but if people dont think its safe to take up what is now available to them, they wont come.

"2020-05-01T18:14:57Z","football","Football","Dave Kitson faces backlash from black players in bid to become head of PFA","Dave Kitsons bid to become chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association has received a blow after the chairman of Kick It Out questioned his anti-racism credentials and three black players attacked the former Reading strikers controversial comments about Raheem Sterling. Kitson launched his campaign to replace Gordon Taylor as the head of the PFA this week but he faces an uphill battle to win the support of black players, who have not forgotten how he reacted to a Chelsea supporter racially abusing Sterling in December 2018 by saying that the Manchester City forwards social media posts had antagonised people.   Related: PFA's Gordon Taylor not cutting salary but donates 500,000 to NHS and charity   The 40-year-old was accused of excusing racism after suggesting Sterling had made himself a target during an appearance on TalkSport and his bid to replace Taylor has been met with an angry response from current and former professionals. Jobi McAnuff said Kitsons remarks about Sterling had crossed a line and the Leyton Orient captains views were backed up by Marvin Sordell, the former Bolton striker, and Marcus Bean, the former Brentford and Wycombe midfielder. Sanjay Bhandari, the head of Kick It Out, footballs anti-discrimination charity, said: The PFA are valued partners of Kick It Out. Anyone who has aspirations to lead the PFA in the future must have in mind the best interests of all players. Given Dave Kitsons previous remarks, I would be deeply concerned about his ability to represent black players. He needs to win their confidence and I doubt he can do that. At the time Kitson said Sterlings posts were no excuse whatsoever for racially abusing somebody, but you sow a seed amongst people who are not racist, not to like that particular person, because they dont want to see that in their faces every day. When contacted by the Guardian about the reaction to his PFA bid he said: My objective is to ensure that the policies of the union reflect the needs and aspirations of all its members. Very importantly, that must include a much more effective anti-racism policy. McAnuff, who spent a season in the Premier League with Reading, said: Hes had his say on certain matters, particularly on Raheem Sterling, and that certainly was something that I objected to in the most severe manner. Hes almost saying he brought on any racist abuse himself. That is inexcusable. Even if Raheem Sterling had been posting pictures of his lifestyle, that gives nobody a right to racially abuse somebody. The fact he could suggest that was a reason is completely unacceptable. Ive gone on Dave Kitsons Instagram and seen some of the pictures hes put on, which would be similar to what he was saying about Raheem showing off. He has pictures with a gun, he has pictures with flash cars after his retirement. It was massively hypocritical. McAnuff insisted an apology would not suffice for him. A line has been crossed, he said. I cant see that many other players in my position would accept an apology and be happy to move on. Sordell, who retired last year, was asked whether he thought Kitson is unfit to lead the union. Absolutely, he said. The PFA represents players. They are where players go for protection. Whether thats happened or not in the past or currently is a different debate. If we look forward to the future and to somebody who makes excuses for racism and doesnt protect the player, how can we look to those people for protection in the future. What he said is so wrong and its that mentality that stops us progressing. What he said isnt necessarily racist but it allows room for racism to grow. It allows people to think saying certain things is OK. It isnt. Bean, who also retired last year, said: Its audacity. Having someone like that in charge would leave a sour taste in my mouth. I would vehemently protest it before he was in charge. He wouldnt receive my vote and Id be actively trying to rectify the situation if he was in charge. People arent happy. Not just players but also black agents I speak to and other staff in the game. People are asking how this can be representative of us.","698"
"2020-05-01T18:12:02Z","world","World news","Calls for health funding to be prioritised as poor bear brunt of Covid-19","The government must prioritise health funding for the most deprived regions in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, politicians and public health experts have demanded, after new data analysis revealed the devastating scale of the death toll in the poorest parts of England and Wales.
In findings one expert said highlighted the fact that Covid-19 is not a leveller as politicians have repeatedly claimed, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that those living in the poorest parts of England and Wales were dying at twice the rate of those in the richest areas.

interactive

With 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people in the most deprived places compared with 25.3 in the least deprived, the Kings Fund health thinktank demanded the government focus new resources to reverse health inequalities as the crisis eases.
The findings came as another 739 people died across the UK, bringing the total to 27,510. They echo last weeks report from the Guardian that members of ethnic minority groups were particularly badly affected by the virus, with those from BAME backgrounds overrepresented in the toll by 27%.
Responding to the analysis at the governments briefing on Friday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, acknowledged the issue, saying: This is something we are worried about and looking at.
He added, however, that the findings should be seen in the context of disproportionate deaths among men, older people, minorities and other subgroups. Were looking at it in the context of all of the different ways that this disease seems to have a different impact, he said.
Critics said impact of austerity in the poorest communities was behind the new data. Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor for the Liverpool city region argued that deprivation must be a factor in how spending is allocated to deal with costs incurred during the crisis.. Liverpool has one of the highest Covid-19 death rates outside London, with 303 deaths, amounting to 81.8 deaths per 100,000 people, and is the local authority to have suffered the biggest cuts to its budget since 2010.
The city regions councils are already warning of a 137m funding gap between the money they have spent dealing with coronavirus and the funds pledged to them by government, said Rotherham. He called for a change in the methodology of the Treasurys green book, which guides government spending, in order to prioritise the most deprived areas  rather than the per capita approach it currently takes.
Deprivation should be factored into Treasury-book methodology across the board but specifically in relation to this. Local authorities were promised whatever it takes. The first allocation of fund was given on a needs basis but the second wasnt, he said.

Maggi Morris, a health consultant and former head of public health in Central Lancashire, said the economic policies of Conservative-led governments of the last decade had done nothing to actually help reduce health inequalities. In fact, they have exacerbated them, she said.
The government must reverse benefit changes, she said, particularly cuts to housing allowance and the bedroom tax, which had forced more people to live in cramped accommodation where disease spreads more easily.
The ONS data exposed the lie that Coronavirus attacks all equally, she said. It is not a leveller. More people who are at social economic disadvantage will not only get ill but get iller and will die in numbers greater than the privileged. This disease knows where to find the weakest links.
Along with the Kings Fund, she called for a national strategy to tackle health inequality. There has been no national strategy because it doesnt want to acknowledge that disparities exist, she said.
Londons poorest boroughs have the highest Covid-19 death rates in led by England and Wales, led by Newham, with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent with 141.5 and 127.4 in Hackney. Other local authorities including Hertsmere, Salford, Watford, Luton, Sandwell and Slough also had rates above 65 deaths per 100,000 people.
In Middlesbrough, where 89 people have died of Coronavirus  which amounts to 79 deaths per 100,000  male life expectancy is just 75.3, compared with almost 84 in the wealthy London borough of Westminster.
Andy McDonald, the local Labour MP, said: The health profile of Middlesbrough is awful and we know what thats about. Its about poverty and inequality and you cant get away from that.

The ONS data is age-standardised, which means the age profile of people living in each area has been accounted for. But David Buck, the former deputy director for health inequalities at the department of health and now a policy advisor at the Kings Fund, said he suspected further data analysis would show that younger people were dying from Covid-19 in the poorest areas.
We know that the more deprived your situation the more likely you are to have co-morbidities such as diabetes. We know that those multiple, long term conditions are much more prevalent the poorer you are but also in a younger age group  I havent looked at the data but that would be my bet, said Buck.





The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
The UN agency advises people to:

Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap
Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing
Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough
Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers
Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection

Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. 
In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.
If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.





The government should reintroduce targets to reduce inequality, which were scrapped by the coalition government in 2012, said Buck: There were very specific health inequality targets, for life expectancy differences across the country and mortality differences. The Kings Fund thinks it is time we return to a national health inequality strategy.
And Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said the figures show the government can no longer continue a one-size-fits-all approach and that ethnic minorities were overrepresented in the worst-paid and key-worker jobs.
The government needs to roll out more economic and social measures that also take into account BAME socioeconomic and housing circumstances, such as overcrowding. At the moment, the government has told older people to self isolate, but thats not a practical solution for older people living in overcrowded housing.
She added the focus on PPE must include all key workers, not just the NHS.
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: We have commissioned urgent work from Public Health England to understand the different factors that may influence the way someone is affected by this virus. We will set out full details in due course.



Nick Stripe, ONS head of health analysis, said: General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas. But so far Covid-19 appears to be taking them higher still.
Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April, an overwhelming proportion were of people from the poorest areas.","1088"
"2020-05-01T18:02:18Z","politics","Politics","Labour appoints panel to investigate leaked report on staff","Labours ruling national executive committee (NEC) has appointed a four-person panel to investigate the leaked internal report describing a hyper-factional environment among party staff hostile to Jeremy Corbyn. The unredacted report, which was leaked last month, reignited the row in the party over Labours handling of antisemitism cases, and led to calls for party members named in it to be suspended. A party spokesperson said on Friday that Martin Forde QC would chair the investigation, which will cover both the contents of the report, and the circumstances of its release. A spokesperson said Forde would be supported by three experts in the law and the Labour partys structures, and would examine the circumstances, contents and release of an internal report. The NEC has agreed that the investigation should endeavour to deliver its report by the middle of July, the spokesperson said. The report included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff members, many of them expressing hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaning Labours better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election. The officials discussed funnelling election campaign funds to favoured candidates, including the former deputy leader Tom Watson. The dossier also named complainants in antisemitism cases. It was prepared as a background document, intended to be submitted alongside Labours response to the Equality and Human Rights Commissions investigation into the party. When Labours lawyers decided the document should not be submitted, it was leaked. Starmer said at the time he was shocked by its contents, and by the fact that it had been published. His handling of the sensitive issue is regarded by both sides of the party as an early test of his leadership. In addition to Forde, the panellists will be three Labour peers: Debbie Wilcox, a former leader of Newport city council; Larry Whitty, a former Labour party general secretary, and Ruth Lister, an emeritus professor of social policy at Loughborough University. Some leftwing NEC members objected to the makeup of the panel. They argued for the veteran campaigner Lord Dubs, who is Jewish, to be included  but were defeated 18-16 in a vote. A Labour source said:, Keir and Angela [Rayner] hold Alf Dubs in the highest regard, as we all do, but it is crucial that the panel is not just independent but perceived as independent. Keir did not think it would be appropriate for someone who was a high profile supporter in his leadership campaign to be involved. A spokesperson for Momentum said: It is critical that the inquiry focus on the very serious allegations of racism, sexism, senior staff members trying to sabotage Labours 2017 general election campaign and a failure to pursue antisemitism cases. In any other organisation, members accused of racism, sexism and misuse of funds would be suspended pending investigation. Labour should be no different, and we call on Labour to suspend those named in the report while the investigation is ongoing.","488"

Mark Di Stefano, who joined the FT from Buzzfeed in January, tweeted on Friday that he had resigned and was going to take some time away and log off. Di Stefano had been accused of listening to the audio feed of video conference calls held by the Independent and its sister title the Evening Standard about responding to the financial impact of coronavirus. The FT suspended Di Stefano, who broke the news of the meetings on Twitter at the same time as staff were being informed, after the Independent discovered the eavesdropping from an analysis of Zoom log files and alerted the newspapers managers.  Hi, letting everyone know today was my last day at the FT. This afternoon I offered my resignation. Thank you everyone who has given support. Im now going to take some time away and log off x— Mark Di Stefano (@MarkDiStef) May 1, 2020  Last week, the FT received a complaint from the Independent that a reporter had joined a staff conference call without authorisation, an FT spokeswoman said. Access details had been shared with him. The journalist in question has now resigned from the company. The FT wishes to apologise to the Independent and the Evening Standard, which subsequently informed the FT that the same reporter had accessed a meeting it had held. Di Stefanos actions raised questions about whether or not he had broken the law, given the meetings were not password protected. Christopher Hutchings, a lawyer at Hamlins who has dealt with a number of phone hacking cases, says Zoombombing could be in breach of the Computer Misuse Act and data protection and privacy laws. Di Stefanos actions were in breach of the FTs code of conduct, which states: The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by  intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails. Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge  can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means. Hutchings said there was no a public interest defence to invoke in the case. I would be extremely doubtful that the journalists conduct and actions would enable him to rely on this argument, he said.","354"
"2020-05-01T17:38:11Z","world","World news","European schools get ready to reopen despite concern about pupils spreading Covid-19","More countries across Europe are preparing to reopen schools in the coming weeks despite conflicting advice from scientists, some of whom caution against underestimating childrens potential to spread the coronavirus. Some schools and nurseries in Denmark and Norway have already reopened, and grandparents in Switzerland are allowed to hug grandchildren under 10, following a ruling by the health ministrys head of infectious diseases that it is safe to do so. Frances president, Emmanuel Macron, has gone against the advice of the governments scientific committee by announcing that creches and primary and nursery schools will reopen progressively from 11 May. Playgrounds began reopening in Germany on Friday and pupils aged 11 and 12 are due to return to school in a staggered system starting next week. Classes will be split in two and the groups will alternate between lessons at school and at home. Hygiene measures being adopted across Europe include strict handwashing and disinfection regimes, physical distancing and the demarcation of playgrounds into zones to ensure pupils do not mix more than necessary. Children will have to file out of classrooms at different times to maintain physical distancing. Germany has temporarily removed sport and music lessons from the curriculum because they are considered too great a risk, but older pupils already returned to sit exams last month. Nurseries will remain closed for all children, except those of key workers, for the time being. French lower secondary schools may only return in areas where the virus is not widely circulating. All ball games and contact sports will be banned and objects touched by more than one pupil must be disinfected. Classes will be staggered and made up of a maximum of 15 pupils, and breaks will held in shifts to avoid overcrowding in corridors and playgrounds.  Lockdown-easing map  Many teachers say the draft health protocol detailing the regulations is unworkable, especially for classes of younger children. Cline Prier-Cheron, a trade union representative and teacher at a primary school in the Eure-et-Loir, told French TV: How do you explain to children in nursery schools that they have to raise their hand to take an object, get up, go talk to a friend while respecting the barrier and distancing rules? This health protocol cannot be applied as it is, especially in nursery schools. Teaching is based on the handling of objects, especially in nursery. If we have to disinfect objects each time a child has handled them, itll be impossible. The parents federation, the FCPE, tweeted that parents were reluctant to send children back to school. That is what our members are telling us, but they are obviously also under constraints from their employers, it wrote. But there are still too many uncertainties. The president of Germanys main teachers union, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, said he supported the plan to teach children in alternating shifts, but that regulating hygiene measures was a mammoth task.  Despite the phased reopenings, scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution. Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said Christian Drosten, a virologist and Germanys leading coronavirus expert, who led the team. Drostens study, which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April.    He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus. Data on children has been scant because of the lack of tests that have been carried out on them, often because they show few if any symptoms. The end result is as clear as glass, Drosten said on his podcast with the broadcaster NDR. Children do not have significantly different concentrations of the virus in their respiratory passages compared to adults. Drosten said children were as likely to spread the virus as adults, particularly given their social behaviour, including an inability to practice physical distancing, their increased mobility and a tendency to sing and cry  activities proven to give the virus droplets as much force as a cough or a sneeze.  Lothar Wieler, the head of Germanys leading disease control body, the Robert Koch Institute, said on Thursday that children play just as important a role in spreading the disease as adults. They can be infected, they can excrete the virus and they can infect others, he said.","804"
"2020-05-01T17:29:24Z","law","Law","Peter Walsh obituary","My great friend Peter Walsh, who has died suddenly aged 66 from undetected heart disease, was a criminal defence barrister committed to protecting civil and legal rights and a dedicated football mentor who founded, funded and coached youth teams. Peter was born in Clydebank, Glasgow, one of three children of Tommy Walsh, a docker, and his wife, Sadie (nee Dolan). Home life in Glasgow was unhappy and when Peter was eight, his mother took the children away to Hull, where she qualified as a teacher. There Peter grew up in a socialist community and his mother succeeded in becoming a primary headteacher. His stepfather, Walt Cunningham, was a dockers shop steward and later city councillor. After attending the local Buckingham Street primary school, in 1964 Peter went to the new David Lister high school, Hulls first comprehensive. There, he thrived, representing the school at football, cricket, rugby, badminton, volleyball, hockey and cross-country running. But his time at David Lister came to a premature end when he was expelled aged 17 for persistent lateness and alleged insolence. He felt unjustly treated and it was a formative experience. With the help of a maths teacher, Harry Gurevitch, with whom Peter formed a lasting bond, he took his A-levels at another Hull comprehensive, the Leo Schultz high school. Peter then went to City of London Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University) and took a degree in politics and government, maintaining his sporting activities. He captained the football team to national success, winning the British Polytechnics Cup in 1976, and the following year became president of the student union. He then studied law  also at City Polytechnic  and was called to the bar in 1982 at Grays Inn. After his pupillage in Middlesbrough, he practised in Newcastle, at 46 Grainger Street and finally Trinity Chambers, where his commitment to justice blossomed and he became well known for supporting junior staff. He was a successful criminal defence barrister, driven by the principle that a person charged with a crime is entitled to representation by an independent advocate whose skills as a lawyer should be of the highest order. Peter started youth football teams wherever he lived and funded them himself: Clara Vale Celtic, Wylam Celtic and in 2003 he revived football in Corbridge, where he lived, welcoming players of all abilities and giving life to the now thriving Tynedale Football club. He played cricket for Stocksfield and Corbridge, was a qualified football coach and referee and was still playing football and cricket right up to his death. Peter remained a staunch Celtic fan. He also had a lifelong love of Hull Kingston Rovers, passed on by his stepdad, and visited from Corbridge as often as possible to watch them.  Peter loved being outdoors, walking Murphy, his beloved dog, growing his own vegetables on his allotment and cooking for his family. He walked Hadrians wall and climbed the three peaks, and had been planning to do the coast-to-coast walk this year. Peter is survived by his wife, Debbie (nee Lynch), whom he married in 1986, their children, Adam, Rose Erin, Caitlin and Patrick, and his siblings, Rosemary and Thomas. ","522"

Roache, 57, unexpectedly stepped down from the top role in Britains third-largest trade union on Tuesday, after being re-elected just five months ago. Initially the GMB, which represents 600,000 workers including ambulance drivers and manufacturing staff, said Roache had taken the difficult decision to resign because of ill health. A day later it updated its statement, giving more details about Roaches health and confirming that an inquiry into claims made against him was under way. It confirmed it had received an anonymous letter a week earlier. Plant and the GMBs acting general secretary, John Phillips, wrote to all its staff on Friday afternoon thanking them for their resilience and saying it had been an incredibly difficult few days for everyone. The letter said a full, transparent and independent investigation into the number of very serious allegations made by way of an anonymous letter had been agreed. It added: In the meantime, the safety and security of all staff is of paramount importance. We are acting with urgency to create a safe space for staff to anonymously raise  [any issues]. They encouraged people to come forward to report any concerns, and promised their full support. On Thursday Plant had tweeted: The safety of our people, particularly women, and the integrity of our union is paramount to me as GMB national president. I support a fully independent investigation into the serious allegations raised around the departure of our previous GS [general secretary]. I support a safe space for our people to come forward with any concerns. We stand for dignity or we stand for nothing. The Guardian has seen an anonymous letter, which purports to be from concerned GMB staff, which urged the union to suspend Tim Roache with immediate effect, pending a full investigation. On Wednesday, following questions regarding Roaches conduct, the GMB issued a statement, which said: GMB received an anonymous letter, last Wednesday, in which a number of allegations have been made about Tims conduct whilst he held the office of general secretary. The statement said Roache  who led the union from 2015  had been diagnosed some years ago with ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and had been advised to refrain from work. Roache, who was often seen as a critic of Jeremy Corbyn, has been a key figure within the union movement. The GMB  which backed Lisa Nandy in the Labour leadership contest  has donated more than 12m to the party over the past five years, according to Electoral Commission records. Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for Keir Starmer declined an offer to back Roache following his resignation. Roache has been approached for comment. ","497"

Against a backdrop of rising tension between the worlds two economic superpowers, share prices resumed a downward slide on Friday with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London. Selling pressure resumed on Wall Street after recording gradual gains in recent weeks amid rising hopes a turning point had been reached for the coronavirus crisis. As fears over the economic costs from the disease mount and as the White House ramped up the threat of a renewed trade conflict with Beijing, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 2% in afternoon trading in New York. Stock prices fell sharply in Japan, with the Nikkei index of leading Japanese company shares sliding by more than 500 points, or 2.8%. Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea were closed for public holidays. Despite world leaders starting to outline plans to lift lockdown measures more than a month on from the depths of the crisis, the economic fallout from tight controls on social and business activity during the Covid-19 outbreak are now becoming increasingly clear.    Faced with a deep recession in an election year, Trump escalated his attack on Beijing by claiming he had seen evidence showing the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The US president is increasingly making Chinas handling of the pandemic a major issue as his ratings sag ahead of his November re-election campaign. Reports suggested the White House is crafting renewed import tariffs that would be applied to Chinese imports in retaliation, in a major escalation of the trade standoff. The US and China had signed the first phase of a trade deal earlier this year to de-escalate trade tensions between Washington and Beijing that had damaged global growth last year and sapped business investment around the world. However, progress has been derailed at the onset of a blame game over Covid-19 as the number of infections around the world climbs, with the US recording the highest official death toll of any country so far. Analysts warned a renewed US-China trade conflict, as the world heads for the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s, could inflict additional damage for jobs and growth. Brad Bechtel, of the US bank Jefferies, said: It seems that as we start to unwind lockdown measures and head back into election season the Trump administration will amp up the blame-game rhetoric, further alienating China. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at the financial trading platform IG, said a trade war was the last thing markets want right now.    As the economic costs from the coronavirus mount, unemployment in the US has surged by more than 30 million in the past six weeks. US growth figures this week showed that the American economy contracted by 4.8% in the first three months of the year, the sharpest decline since 2008. Major companies issued a barrage of negative updates on Friday as businesses around the world count the financial costs of lockdown. Against a backdrop of plunging oil prices as demand for crude evaporates with economic activity in developed countries close to a standstill, the US oil company ExxonMobil reported a loss after $3bn was wiped off the value of its oil reserves.  In the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland took an 800m profit hit because of the pandemics economic effects, while Ryanair said it was planning to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the crisis. Chris Iggo, of the investment management firm Axa, said recovery momentum in financial markets over recent weeks was fading amid the growing realisation that exiting lockdown measures would be difficult. There is lots to ponder about how we emerge from lockdown  Social distancing and a high level of focus on health will remain features of our lives for some time to come.","672"

The boroughs rate  144.3 deaths per 100,000 people  is closely followed by Brent in north London (141.5), and Newhams neighbour Hackney (127.4), according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics. The data confirms what Islam has suspected all along: people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying from Covid-19 at a much higher rate than those in the richest. On Islams road and neighbouring street, 22 people have died after contracting coronavirus. Every day I get a message from someone in my community telling me of people who have died. They are young and old. Its been really tough, Islam said. His wife, who wished to remain anonymous, said: You hear sad stories of people dying and no one was with them. It does affect people mentally.    A closed corner shop in Newham.

The pandemic comes nearly a decade after the area hosted the 2012 Olympic Games, and has become a stark reminder that the better jobs, housing and quality of life that were promised have failed to materialise. Though parts of the borough have undergone regeneration and housing prices have rocketed, the legacy of the games wasnt felt by all. Rokhsana Fiaz, who was elected mayor of Newham nearly two years ago, said: Ive grown up in the borough and lived here all my life. Like many of my friends, the opportunities that were promised with regards to the Olympics werent necessarily felt by me or my peer group. Theres a real sense of haves and have nots in the community. My promise has been were going to reverse that because everyone in Newham needs to have a stake. The boroughs deprivation and diversity makes it particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. More than half of children live in poverty, while the rate of households in temporary accommodation is one of the highest in England. A study commissioned by the council found that up to 36,000 people are not paid the legally required national minimum wage. Newham has the most diverse population profile of any local authority in the country. Some 78% of residents are from ethnic minority communities, which has been reported as a risk factor for the coronavirus. Many live in intergenerational households and there are longstanding health inequalities.    Tahir Mirza, chair of East Ham Labour party. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian   Tahir Mirza, Newham resident and chair of the local Labour party in East Ham, described the deaths in his area as truly shocking and called for more efforts for people in the community to get guidelines on social distancing in their own language. He said many didnt speak English and were simply unaware of the dangers they faced. The consequences of failing to reach these people will be dire, he said: People will continue to die otherwise. Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said areas like Newham show the discussion about PPE and testing needs to go much further than just the NHS. Key workers, from taxi drivers and care workers to grocery shop owners, who are disproportionately from a BAME background, also require protective equipment. BAME key workers arent just NHS staff. We need to start asking whether they are getting proper PPE equipment. Are they being protected? Are they being tested? Is that infrastructure there? Peter Raison, a 58-year-old train driver for Transport for London who lives across the road from Islam, is also not surprised by the high level of mortality. Many like him on their street have to go to work and even he isnt being provided with PPE. He is upset that there are people still failing to socially distance as the death tolls increase. People are just assuming its not going to happen to me.   ","775"

Outside politics, he had a varied career that included university teaching in sociology, adult education and industrial studies. Born in Sheffield, Peter was the son of Len Jackson, an undertaker who became a rating officer for the Sheffield local authority, and his wife, Mary (nee Manyer), who ran a car hire company. He attended Nether Edge grammar school, where he took an interest in the Common Wealth party and read what was then the Manchester Guardian. Leaving school at the age of 16, Peter trained as an accountant in a Sheffield firm. He was conscripted into the RAF when he turned 18, and was posted to a Norfolk airbase, where a current affairs tutor suggested he should go to university. He went to Durham in 1949 to study sociology, with the aim of becoming a social worker. Instead, he left to take a teaching diploma at University College Leicester (now Leicester University), then registered for a PhD on John Stuart Mill while a research assistant at Liverpool University. He completed it in 1973 at Hull University. In Leicester he joined the Labour party, and became its candidate for High Peak in Derbyshire at the 1966 general election. He won the seat  its first Labour MP. He was the sole party member to vote against the Prices and Incomes Act 1966, which sought to stifle wage rises to control inflation, to the displeasure of Wilson, the prime minister. He was involved as a whip in the private members bills leading to the Abortion Act 1967 and the Divorce Reform Act 1969, as well as the Sexual Offences Act 1967 on homosexuality. He lost his seat in 1970 and went back to Hull for two years, before another two as a tutor at the Open University. I was the Labour party agent for High Peak at both general elections of 1974, including February, when Peter unsuccessfully attempted to regain the seat. He became a planning officer for South Yorkshire metropolitan council in 1974 but had a serious car accident in 1977. After recovery, he stood unsuccessfully as the 1979 Labour MEP candidate for Birmingham North. Peter taught at Roma University in Lesotho from 1980 to 1984 before returning to adult teaching for the university at Hull and at Matlock for Nottingham University. He was also director of the Access Committee charity in London, which was concerned with access for disabled people; and did work for a Welsh company manufacturing materials for the construction of houses for disabled people. He retired in 1992 but served on an industrial tribunal until the age of 70. Peter left the Labour party with Tony Blairs leadership, but rejoined in 2015 when Jeremy Corbyn was elected. In retirement Peter and his second wife, Liz (nee Henderson), travelled often to Australia to visit family. He was taken ill while on a cruise and died in Panama. He is survived by Liz and his stepson, Paul Guthrie.","522"

A page belonging to the former footballer was removed for repeatedly violating Facebooks policies on harmful misinformation, the company said on Friday.
But while the deleted page had more than 770,000 followers, a secondary account with more than 68,000 followers remained active. A verified account for him also remained on Twitter, which said it was prioritising the removal of Covid-19 content when it had a call to action that could potentially cause harm.
The move by Facebook came ahead of a call by an anti-hate group, the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), for social networks to remove Icke from their platforms. It was backed by figures including the doctors and broadcasters Christian Jessen, Dawn Harper and Pixie McKenna.

It also comes against the backdrop of attacks on mobile phone masts across the UK and elsewhere at a time amid concern about the impact of baseless theories linking coronavirus to 5G networks.
A report by the CCDH claims that Ickes conspiracies about coronavirus have been viewed more than 30m times. Based on an analysis of videos that feature Icke speaking about the coronavirus on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, the group described him as the leading producer of misinformation on Covid-19.

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said that Facebook must now look at what he described as a vast network of pages and groups in which Ickes content was being shared.
While people around the world make enormous sacrifices to stall this pandemic, social media firms are instead profiting from the proliferation of misinformation on their platforms, he said.
Misinformation puts all of our lives at risk by encouraging the public not to comply with clinical guidance.
The action against Ickes social media presence was also welcomed by Hope Not Hate, which said: Ickes deluded, often antisemitic, posts encourage harmful lies to spread. Other platforms should follow Facebooks lead.
The local television station London Live was sanctioned recently after the media regulator, Ofcom, found it had posed a threat to the publics health by showing a lengthy interview with Icke about the coronavirus pandemic.
Icke, who has repeated discredited claims that the pandemic is linked to 5G, had used the broadcast to claim without evidence that the pandemic was cover for a supposed global world order to crash the economy, end the use of cash payments and track people.

"2020-05-01T16:55:47Z","world","World news","Is 100,000 tests a day an effective strategy against coronavirus?","Is 100,000 enough for tracking and tracing? The government has been accused of counting some tests prematurely, reportedly expanding its daily count to include tests that have been sent out in the post, rather than those actually carried out in labs. While it denies the charge, regardless of whether the 100,000 target has been met, countries that have taken a test, trace, isolate approach are running a far higher proportion of tests to positive cases than the UK. Germany, which is down to fewer than 1,000 daily positive cases, is performing nearly 1m tests per week. South Korea is doing 15,000 tests per day, but has had no more than 100 daily cases since the beginning of April. So, for a robust test, trace, isolate regime in the UK, the number of tests would need to be vastly increased or we would need to wait for the number of cases in the community to fall significantly. Will healthcare workers be screened? There have been calls for healthcare workers to undergo routine weekly screening to ensure that transmission between staff and patients is minimised. This is particularly important as people are known to be infectious before symptoms appear, meaning that hospitals could become hotspots for infection. However, regular screening of staff requires testing to be performed in hospitals or very nearby, and may also require staff to be available to take swabs. The governments approach of centralising testing raises questions about how quickly local capacity could be rolled out to facilitate this. Is the right data being collected and reported? Questions have been raised about whether the data currently being collected is sufficient to support a test, trace, isolate programme, and community surveillance to pick up early signs of upticks in transmission in an area. Are testing centres starting to collect postcode information of those tested, for instance, or are they merely recording whether samples come back positive or negative? There are also concerns among statisticians that data is not being reported in a way that allows useful analysis. For instance, breakdowns of the number of positive tests from hospital patients, health workers and other groups have not been provided, and it is not clear why so many of the tests being performed appear to be repeat tests of the same person on the same day.    Are the right people getting the tests? The rationale of the prioritisation of different groups  testing has this week been expanded to key workers, those who need to go out to work and over-65s  has not been clearly explained and there are still some groups reporting serious problems getting access to testing. Care home staff, in particular, have struggled to access tests, despite signs that the numbers of deaths in care homes will be very high. Given that care home residents do not have the option to self-isolate, it is crucial that staff are tested  and ideally regularly screened  to keep the virus out. Is the quality of testing good enough? In the rapid surge of testing, including at drive-throughs around the country, concerns have emerged about the reliability of test results and delays. Staff working in mega-labs have reported concerns about mislabelling of samples and lost results. Some people, including healthcare staff, have complained of waiting days or weeks for a result. There are also concerns that many drive-through sites are asking members of the public to self-administer swab tests, which could result in the samples being suboptimal.","574"

The US oil company reported a loss of $610m for the first quarter of the year following the outbreak of coronavirus, compared to a profit of $2.4bn in the same months last year. The financial slump includes a $2.9bn writedown to the value of its oil reserves after oil prices tumbled by more than 70% this year due to the sudden drop in demand for oil and transport fuels as major economies impose Covid-19 lockdowns.   Related: Fossil fuel firms linked to Trump get millions in coronavirus small business aid   In the US, oil prices turned negative for the first time owing to a catastrophic oversupply of oil that risks overwhelming traditional oil storage facilities and has forced traders to turn to empty crude tankers, rail freight containers and salt caverns to store the unwanted crude.

Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters   Darren Woods, Exxons chief executive, said: Covid-19 has significantly impacted near-term demand, resulting in oversupplied markets and unprecedented pressure on commodity prices and margins. The price of US oil, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), climbed to around $20 a barrel on Friday ahead of planned production cuts from the worlds largest oil producers which are due to begin this month. The global oil price, Brent crude, rose to more than $26 a barrel. Chevron, the second largest oil company in the US, said it would rein in its annual spending plans by a further $2bn this year to $14bn, down sharply from its original $20bn spending budget, in order to safeguard the companys shareholder dividends.  .  Royal Dutch Shell became one of the first major oil companies to cut its shareholder payouts for this year by slashing its dividend by two-thirds. The companys chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said Shell would reduce the dividend for the first time since the second world war because it was prudent in the current environment.

Dunn died in August when his motorcycle collided with a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer stationed at a US spy base at RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire. Sacoolas immediately admitted to the police she had caused the accident by driving on the wrong side of the road.   Related: Harry Dunn death: a timeline of key events   She then left the country a fortnight later claiming diplomatic immunity. The US government has rejected a Home Office request for her to return to the UK to stand trial. The family had also written to Donald Trump urging him to reconsider his refusal to send her back to the UK, but the US government on Thursday again rejected the plea. Downing Street insists it backed the Dunn campaign to persuade Sacoolas to return to face UK courts and had objected to her departure every step of the way. But the familys lawyers, after leaks of internal memos and evidence given to the foreign affairs select committee, believe they were misled. The UK shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has called for a parliamentary inquiry into how the family were treated. It is understood that Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and former director of public prosecutions, is also taking an interest. The family is seeking a judicial review into the handling of the case, which could reveal if there were any conflicting currents within the Foreign Office over whether to resist the US view that she was covered by diplomatic immunity. Any court hearing might also reveal exchanges between the Northamptonshire police and the Foreign Office over the degree of discretion the police had to arrest and prosecute Sacoolas, even if the Foreign Office (FCO) told the police she had diplomatic immunity. Radd Seiger, the lawyer for the Dunn family, said he would be demanding the truth at Fridays meeting: The foreign secretary has stated in each of our meetings with him that the FCO fought to keep Mrs Sacoolas here. The FCOs initial position, like ours, was that Mrs Sacoolas did not have diplomatic immunity. So why did they cave in on this interpretation of the law in a matter of three working days? To make matters worse, they failed to pass any of this to Northants police, who were kept totally in the dark for 14 days when it was their job to establish whether she had immunity or not. Shockingly, the police were not told anything until the day after Mrs Sacoolas left, depriving them of their ability to investigate matters. Sacoolas left the UK on 15 September after the Foreign Office agreed she had diplomatic immunity, and the US refused to waive it. Internal memos suggest the Foreign Office decided she had immunity, a complex point of law, within a week of Dunns death. Seigers argument turns on exchanges between the Foreign Office and the US State Department in the immediate wake of the crash that led to Foreign Office lawyers concluding she did have diplomatic immunity, he says. The Foreign Office negotiated a treaty with the US and the UK that waived immunity for US staff at the Croughton base, but the treaty was silent on the status of the staffs dependants, such as Sacoolas, leading the US to argue she had immunity. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: We have deep sympathy for Harrys family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done. As the foreign secretary set out in parliament, Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. We consistently called for Anne Sacoolass immunity to be waived before she left the UK. Both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have been clear with the US that the refusal to extradite her amounts to a denial of justice, and that she should return to the UK. ","680"

The major sports that attended the meeting  including football, cricket, horse racing and rugby union, as well as UK Sport  were also reminded by the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, that elite sport would return only when it was deemed absolutely safe to do so.   Related: Premier League clubs united in desire to find way to finish season after meeting   A DCMS spokesperson said: We held an initial, constructive meeting with medical representatives from a number of professional and elite sports bodies, government and PHE to step up planning on what may need to be done so that athletes could return to training, when it is deemed safe to do so. This would be ahead of any return to competitive top-level sport which would only happen when medical experts advise that this can be done safely. Discussions with the sports bodies will continue on this. Most of the meeting, which lasted just over an hour, was focused on proposals from a working group led by the UK Sport chief executive, Sally Munday, which has been tasked with determining the steps needed to make it safe for athletes to return to training. One person with knowledge of the meeting said that Munday had reflected the views of several national governing bodies, Olympic and Paralympic groups and sports medical experts, and the primary focus of the discussions was on agreeing sensible steps towards a timetable to get sport reopening again. The first step, the source added, was on opening high-performance training centres for individual sports and athletes such as Peaty. However, it was accepted by all parties that loosening the rules for sport would not happen in isolation from the rest of society  and that it was also important to get the sequencing right in the coming weeks and months.

At the studio he set up in Putney, south-west London, in 1959, Alan pioneered a radical and improvisatory approach to claywork that involved dispensing with an internal armature and allowing content to emerge from his unconscious. Abstract pieces of the 1960s developed into large groups of figures. Pacifism, Jungian psychology and world conflicts were themes that emerged organically in his work. Alan also made a large number of portrait heads from life, including of Tom Stoppard, Colin Davis, AS Neill, Basil Bunting and Enoch Powell. Alan taught sculpture at Morley College in Lambeth for 17 years from 1970 and was subsequently a trustee and then teacher at the Frink School of Figurative Sculpture in Staffordshire, founded by Rosemary Barnett. He was born in London, the son of Stewart Thornhill (who started life as Sigmund Dornberger), a German Jewish importer of china and glass, and his wife, Louisa (nee Warren). Alan grew up in Fittleworth, Sussex, and was educated at Radley college, in Oxfordshire, and Oxford University, where he studied history. He was an officer in the Gloucestershire Regiment during the second world war and aide-de-camp to Gen Sir Percy Hobart. He took part in the D-day landings and later became a conscientious objector.    Alan Thornhill in his studio in Putney, south-west London, in 2009. Photograph: Anne Purkiss   Having had Reichian therapy in Norway after the war, he decided to work with his hands and enrolled at Camberwell Art School, in south-east London, where he began his lifelong exploration of clay. He married the painter Sheila Denning in 1950 and set up Hawkley Pottery, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, in 1951. Growing tired of the repetitive nature of pottery, Alan began to make figurative sculptures in clay, exploring the theme of communication. Moving back to London, he set up the studio in Putney, which he maintained until his death. In later life Alan painted prolifically, creating self-portraits, still lifes and landscapes of Gloucestershire and France, together with large bold charcoal drawings. He moved from London to Stroud in 1994 with his partner, Kate Shuckburgh, and in 2012 had a retrospective at Strouds Museum in the Park. Alan donated nine bronze pieces to Wandsworth borough council which form the permanent Putney Sculpture Trail near the Thames, opened in 2008. The council leader, Ravi Govindia, said that Alans creative genius has provided a long-lasting legacy for the people of Putney. His contribution to cultural life in the borough cannot be overestimated. Alan is survived by three children  myself and Teresa, from his marriage, which ended in divorce in 1970, and Philip, from a relationship with Suzie Bittner  and five grandchildren, Isaac, Bethan, Jake, Maya and Eva.

Only a little later did the message arrive from the airlines chief executive, Alex Cruz, confirming possible reductions in headcount. Although ominous warnings about aviations biblical losses and bankrupt airlines had been ringing out for weeks, the announcement to the stock exchange by BAs parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), still came as a shock. Until that moment the biggest, most profitable carriers, had made only smaller cuts, furloughing staff and reducing fleet orders.    Air France aircraft grounded due to lockdown at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. The French government has offered a 7bn loan bailout to the flag carrier. Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images   And around Europe, governments were rushing to guarantee the survival of their flag carriers, with billions of state aid. As Air France and KLM sealed a 10bn package between them, and German ministers pledged to back Lufthansa, Cruz told his staff that there was no government bailout standing by for BA. But why? A refrain echoed by several past and present employees is that BA was never an airline to let a crisis go to waste. The situation was, as Cruz headlined a previous all-staff memo in March, a matter of survival. But, if convincing the government to resist bailing out all airlines meant BA could ultimately survive a crisis that might fatally wound its nemesis, Virgin Atlantic, and let it force through unwelcome changes on its own unionised workforce  for BA bosses, recovery would be sweet indeed. Despite Cruzs blunt words on state aid, the decision was a matter for owners IAG, which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus. So far it has remained tight-lipped  but on Friday it accepted a 1bn loan backed by the Spanish government, just three days after the BA redundancies were announced.    Willie Walsh, the CEO of BAs parent, IAG, in London last year, has argued against bailouts for airlines in the past and sought to restructure BA when he was its boss. Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA-EFE   IAGs chief executive, Willie Walsh, has long set out his stall against handouts in the UK. In January, when most carriers were still regarding coronavirus as a blip that might impact long-haul routes to China, the future of one regional carrier, Flybe, was deemed significant enough for government intervention. But as ministers looked set to offer assistance, IAG cried foul. Flybe was owned by a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic, BAs old rival, which had grand visions of the doomed airline being its own domestic feeder network as it became a second flag carrier at Heathrow. Later, when the full extent of the coronavirus crisis hit, and airlines led by Virgin called for a bailout for the beleaguered sector, IAG was quick to distance itself. Walsh said they were having no dialogue with any governments for handouts, adding: I think governments would expect airlines to look at self-help before they would call on governments to provide state aid. They did, however, avail of general facilities offered in Rishi Sunaks economic stimulus: about 22,000 BA staff were furloughed, worth up to 110m. Meanwhile, in a sealed IAG office inside BAs Waterside HQ near Heathrow, a team of around 80, largely the bean counters of the group, set to work on emergency plans that would revive a long-held vision on how to slash BAs costs. What emerged later on Tuesday night in an email to unions was a proposal of not just job losses but vastly reduced terms and conditions for long-serving pilots, cabin crew and ground staff. Far from cushioning those made redundant, or incentivising voluntary redundancy, the airline said it could now afford to only pay the bare statutory minimum.

Staff that keep their jobs will be forced onto the inferior contracts offered to new entrants since 2010.

For unions, there is little doubt what they see. Unites national officer for aviation, Oliver Richardson said BA was carrying out a brutal act of smash and grab opportunism  simply designed to boost their profits in the future and to try to force other operators out of the UK aviation sector. Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, however, says airlines are now not expecting stability for two to three years. You could say they are securing the future of the business. Clearly people whose terms and conditions are being re-based will argue they are making changes under the cover of the crisis  but you can view it both ways. IAG is a Spanish-based, multinational group, possibly complicating requests for BA, and any state aid might come with constraints unwelcome to shareholders  and IAGs biggest shareholder is Qatars sovereign wealth fund, which grew its stake to 25% in February. However, some in the City and at BA believe that the airline might yet change its tune on state aid once Virgin is either bailed out  or no longer exists. Nonetheless, some carriers expecting state aid are taking decisions that Lobbenberg says would be challenging for labour or governments, such as Lufthansa closing its no-frills operation Germanwings. With the entire sector in such upheaval and no clear, imminent route back to mass travel, it is hard to see what kind of industry, let alone BA, will emerge. Yet few believe BA would abandon Gatwick, or give up valuable Heathrow slots  and losing a quarter of the workforce may not mean shrinking operations by the same amount. Iberia pilots were forced into productivity improvements of 20% more hours when they were restructured after joining IAG in the wake of the financial crisis. As Lobbenberg points out: Vueling is young, and Aer Lingus was restructured by Willie Walsh after 9/11  That leaves BA. Walsh, given a farewell cake and send-off by fellow airline executives in early March before cancelling his retirement, may now finish the job he started.

Although BA is not receiving state aid, around 30bn in grants, loans and guarantees look set to be offered to competitors around Europe.

Simon Dolan, whose Jota Aviation company has been delivering personal protective equipment (PPE) to the NHS, has put the health secretary on notice that he intends to issue proceedings for a judicial review, unless the government reverses some of the lockdown measures and reinstates freedom of movement.
He is taking the action, which echoes that taken by Gina Miller over Brexit, on the grounds that the lockdown was both legally defective and disproportionate in law. He is also seeking minutes of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meetings this year, some of which involved Boris Johnsons adviser Dominic Cummings.
Failure to do so [release the minutes] will result in an application for disclosure if proceedings have to be issued, says the letter before action that has been sent to Matt Hancock.



   default
  


Dolan, the author of a book called How to Make Millions Without a Degree, says he is not taking the case to throw the country into chaos, but to restore the publics right to decide for themselves if they want to visit friends, go to work or stay indoors, according to a crowdfunding page.
He has offered to consider not issuing proceedings if serious, alternative, less draconian suggested restrictions were imposed.
His lawyer, Michael Gardner, said the government had been given until Thursday to reply to the letter. If it does not come back with a satisfactory answer, he will apply for an urgent court hearing in the same way Miller did when she challenged the prorogation of parliament last year.
Dolan runs his chartered airline business out of Southend in Essex and employs about 600 people across 10 companies.
He said he had no political affiliation but mounted the action because he feared the cure for coronavirus would be worse than the disease, with cancer referrals and chemotherapy down and as many as 18,000 extra cancer deaths predicted, according to recent research by University College London. Reports of domestic violence have risen, and police reported early signs of an increase in suicides and suicide attempts.
The lockdown is telling us to stop living to avoid dying, Dolan said. To imprison people in their homes is an extremely dramatic decision to make. It is unprecedented and it would have been a brave Boris to say no, we are not going to do that, but it has gone on too long now, and we need to lift it or loosen it.
Too many people are losing their jobs; people cant get cancer treatment, there is suicide, domestic violence. Why are we prevaricating? Its like the government is now keeping this going to justify their original decision, whereas what they should do is say we did this and now we are doing something different.
His action comes as pressure to relax lockdowns extends around the globe, with the most extreme examples in the US, where gun-toting protesters entered Michigans state building on Thursday.
Its not storming the city halls with guns like in America, but British people have done their bit, made their sacrifices but life has to go on and its going to be really hard for years to come, said Dolan. He said the crowdfunding drive was an attempt to test British peoples backbone as he was amazed nobody else was doing something.
A serial entrepreneur, Dolan, 50, from Essex, is worth 142m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He left school at 16 after clashing with teachers and got his first break at 22, putting a 10 advert in a local paper offering to do peoples accounts.
He started his own motor racing team, Jota Sport, in 2008 after his wife bought him a track day as a birthday present, and now lives in Monaco.

Dolan said the case was funded all the way to the court but he was advised that the crowdfunding would help the budget if it became a prolonged case and would also help to see  how much support was out there from the general public. He said: When people actually start putting their hands in their pockets its a far more powerful message.
Dolans lawyer said the challenge rested on three main points: first, that the lockdown is ultra vires  outside of legal authority  because it implemented regulations under the Public Health Act 1984 instead of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 or the emergency Coronavirus Act 2020; second, that the government reimposed the lockdown on a disproportionate basis in law, using an over-rigid test regarding its effect on containing the disease but not its impact on the economy, jobs and wider health; and third, that it breached the European convention on human rights covering the right to liberty, family life, education and property.

Sajid Hussain, who was granted political asylum in Sweden in 2019 after fleeing Pakistan, had been missing since 2 March. He was last seen boarding a train to Uppsala, a city 35 miles (56km) north of Stockholm. His body was found on 23 April in the Fyris river outside Uppsala, Jonas Eronen, a police spokesman, said. Hussain had been living with a friend, Abdul Malik, in Stockholm when he went missing. Malik said Hussain had been in a good mood before leaving for Uppsala on 2 March. His wife, Shahnaz Baloch, said she had spoken to Hussain over the phone that morning and he had been in good spirits, discussing his plans to move to a new apartment in Uppsala. We just want police to investigate the cause of death and give an answer to his family and friends, said Malik. We want to know what happened. Hussain fled Pakistan in 2012 after his reporting on forced disappearances and human rights violations in the Balochistan region had resulted in the police raiding his house and interrogating his family. He also received death threats. Eronen said a crime could not be completely ruled out, but that Hussains death could equally have been an accident or suicide. The autopsy has dispelled some of the suspicion that he was the victim of a crime, he said. As long as a crime cannot be excluded, there remains the risk that his death is linked to his work as a journalist, said Erik Halkjaer, the head of the Swedish branch of Reporters without Borders (RSF). RSF said Hussains controversial profile meant it could not be ruled out that he had been abducted and killed at the behest of a Pakistani intelligence agency. The countrys foreign ministry declined to comment. Hussain had continued his journalism as chief editor of the Baluchistan Times, an online magazine he founded, from abroad. He wrote about drug trafficking, forced disappearances and a long-running insurgency. He had arrived in Sweden in 2018, after previously moving from the United Arab Emirates to Oman and Uganda. According to his family and friends, he was in the process of bringing his wife and two children to join him in Sweden, and had been due to start a post-graduate degree at the University of Uppsala. Pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, who are regularly harassed and killed. According to the 2019 RSF press freedom index, Pakistan ranked 142 out of 180 countries.","438"
"2020-05-01T16:21:01Z","world","World news","Hancock says UK hit 100,000 tests amid claims tally is artificially boosted","Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was accused of artificially inflating the number of coronavirus tests, as he hailed the rapid expansion that allowed him to reach a self-imposed 100,000-a-day target as a national achievement.
It emerged that a third of the 122,347 tests included in the final 24-hour period before the deadline were counted before they had been carried out.
Around 39,000 had been sent out to households and satellite testing locations, with no guarantee of the timescale for their completion, but were still included in the count.
The figure marked a significant rise on Thursdays total of 81,611 tests, and comfortably exceeded the 100,000 daily target. The latest figure of 122,000 tests were carried out on 73,000 people, with the remainder being retests.
Hancock praised colleagues and private sector partners for the rapid increase in testing capability, which has seen mobile testing units and new labs created  and defended the target itself.
Setting stretching, ambitious goals in a national crisis has a galvanising effect on everyone involved, he said. I knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal, he said. I can announce that we have met our goal.
However, Hancock was criticised by his Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth. Many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out, Ashworth said.
This headline figure shouldnt count tests that hadnt been used or indeed might never be used. Ministers promised us transparency, the public and NHS deserve clarity.





He also complained that the target was never a strategy, saying ministers should be using the lockdown period to put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place.
Earlier on Friday, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government denied there had been a change.
An unnamed senior source told the HSJ that the change had been made because Hancock, the health and social care secretary, was obsessed with honouring his testing pledge.
Last week, an online portal was launched allowing drive-through tests and home testing kits to be booked by symptomatic key workers and, later, over-65s, those needing to work outside the home, care home staff and residents.
Hancock has come under intense pressure over the 100,000-a-day target since making it. At the time, the government was clear that the figure represented the number of people having a test. The current testing total used by ministers includes tens of thousands of retests.
Recently, Hancock stressed that his aim was to have in place by the end of April the capacity to undertake 100,000 daily tests.
According to the HSJ, Chris Wormald, the Department of Healths permanent secretary, signed off what appeared to be a major and previously unannounced change to the way the headline daily number is calculated.
Challenged about the HSJ story, Hancock said: Its not something I recognise.



The governments testing tsar, John Newton, appearing alongside Hancock said: Theres been no change to the way tests are counted.
Thats the way they are counted, have always been counted, and thats the way we were advised to count them by officials.
However the numbers of home testing kits being mailed out was not included in figures before last week as the items were not available.
The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said Hancocks target was always a hostage to fortune, and the truth is, he missed it. He said it was disappointing the government had chosen to massage the metrics rather than admit failure as this would undermine public confidence.
Despite the row about how the tests are accounted for, Hancock said the significantly increased capacity would allow the government to track the progress of the disease more accurately, and to control its spread, once lockdown restrictions are eased.

Boris Johnson announced on Thursday that the government will set out next week a road map for reopening schools and businesses, once the governments scientific advisers deem it safe to do so. This will include what he called a menu of options.
The prime minister said the public were likely to be encouraged to wear masks, as part of the plan for easing restrictions: but his official spokesman insisted on Friday that no formal decision had been made.
Johnson said at Thursdays press conference: I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.
But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken. Ministers are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice, he said.
The advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from  asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible.
The lockdown restrictions imposed on 23 March are set to be reviewed by ministers next Thursday.





Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was  and always will be  central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.
Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.
It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure  originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.
South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.
Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The World Health Organization says it should be the backbone of the response in every country.

Hancock announced that 27,510 people have now died from Covid-19: an increase of 739. The figures have risen significantly since the government began including deaths taking place in care homes, as well as those in hospitals.
The health secretary reiterated the governments determination to recruit 18,000 people to help track the progress of the disease by mid-May, as part of what he called a full-scale test, track and trace model.
If it needs to be bigger, well scale it up as required, he added. He also said the government will shortly release the app it has been trialling, which is aimed at identifying sufferers and warning those they have met.
People will be able to know if theyve been in close contact with someone whos transmitting the disease, and take action if they need to, he said.
The government has come under mounting pressure to explain why it didnt build up the capacity to track the infection earlier  instead, halting the tracing of individual cases in March.



The Conservative MP Greg Clark, who chairs the science and technology committee, wrote a testy public letter to Public Health England on Friday to urge it to publish more evidence about why that decision was made, after it declined to do so.
It is important that the bodies responsible for UK policy and practice are transparent about the basis of vital decisions, he said. It is disappointing that Public Health England has still not disclosed the assessment they made which led them to reject the South Korean approach to testing.
So I ask again for PHE to publish the evidence which informed UK testing strategy, without further delay.
The plea followed a hearing with PHE officials last month.","1127"
"2020-05-01T16:18:17Z","film","Film","'We stick to the rules': why cinemas in Sweden have stayed open during the pandemic","Showing a film in a cinema has become an act of political consequence. Movie theatres across the globe, from China to the US, have shut down during the coronavirus pandemic, and arguments have broken out, as much on ideological lines as economic, as to how and when to reopen. In Sweden, however, some have remained open all along, operating under new government guidelines. With 47 cinemas and about 200 screens, the countrys second-largest chain Svenska Bio stayed operational  and as a result has become Europes biggest operator by box office revenue. Swedes, were born social distancing, says Peter Fornstam, Svenska Bios founder and managing director. I am happy that we kept the doors open and that we are still operating [but] I wish everyone was operating. New rules mean no more than 50 people in the auditorium. By choice, Fornstam has halved theatrical occupancy. Hand sanitising, washing and social distancing is paramount. He has started a plan where the screen can be rented for gaming. There is also the Bio on Demand, which is cinema-on-demand on a real-life big screen. You can choose your own movie and have your own screen with your friends, says Fornstam. The proof is in the pudding. We have had a fair amount of [customers].  Fornstam has been both lauded and reviled for keeping his cinemas open  even more since the biggest cinema chain in Sweden, Filmstaden, closed theirs. The 65-year-old takes a long view. Swedes  there used to be a joke that if every Swede were told to have a blue and a yellow sock, nobody would question the decision but they would question if the colour of the sock could cause cancer, he says. The government said we should do this. So well do this. We can stick to the rules. Also, there are physical and mental issues to deal with, so we try to keep everyone going. Forstams position is in keeping with Swedens more liberal response to the pandemic. While its neighbours Denmark, Finland and Norway went into various versions of lockdown, Sweden closed high schools and universities but allowed kindergartens and primaries to remain open. Theatres, museums and sporting arenas were closed, restaurants remained open. The government said that if social distancing rules are not followed, offending businesses would be shut down. The country has faced heavy criticism from scientists as it recorded a far higher death rate than its neighbours, with Sten Linnarsson, a professor at Swedens Karolinska Institute, saying that there is a lack of scientific evidence being put forward for these policies.   Related: No reopening in sight for US cinemas after federal guidelines issued   However, the Swedish model has been hailed by conservatives in the US  without understanding, according Lars Trgrdh, a history professor at Ersta Skndal Brcke University College, that it depends on the populations compliance with, and trust in, the state. It is interesting to see that the Swedish stress on what we call freedom under responsibility is getting picked up by the libertarian right in the US. The big problem with all of that is that Sweden is all built, ultimately, on a very strong alliance between the state and the individual. Swedes, in effect, follow the recommendations of authorities.  Swedish-American journalist Erik Augustin Palm went even further in an article in Slate, citing Swedens peculiar cultural attributes such as unbounded trust in state experts and an internalised sense of exceptionalism as contributing factors to the belief that the government knows what its doing. It is still possible that Swedens Covid-19 response could be exonerated  say, herd immunity does take effect and Swedens death rate is lower than neighbouring countries at some point  This seems highly unlikely, but still possible.   Trailer for Tenet, due for release in July  In the meantime, Fornstam is waiting on that start of movement further up the movie supply chain, which seems to be focusing around the projected July release of Tenet, Christopher Nolans time-travel epic. He remains convinced that the anticipation of a major big-screen spectacle is proof that cinema  like live music or sports  can be a unique experience. Some people say this is the kiss of death for the cinema, especially in corona times. I think it is the other way around, he says. It is so funny that [the idea] of rent your own cinema has been so successful for us  that shows the strength of going to the movies rather than watching a movie at home. I pray and hope that on 17 July this year, Chris Nolan will be there for us.","741"

While Jeremy Corbyns consensual chairing style involved hearing lengthy contributions from colleagues with contrasting views, Starmer reminds shadow ministers they shouldnt feel obliged to chip in.
With the nation gripped by the Covid-19 crisis, he has taken an equally restrained approach to Labours contribution to the national debate  to varying reviews from those on his own side.
Our pragmatic decision is, first of all to engage on the practical things the government could do that would make peoples lives easier, says Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary.
In my area for instance, thats uprating legacy benefits and ending the benefit cap and the two-child limit in universal credit  rather than saying, Lets have a universal basic income [UBI], or Lets have a minimum income guarantee.
But while his supporters have applauded Starmers approach and argued that a more aggressive line will simply alienate the public at a time of high government popularity, Labour leftwingers have been frustrated at the partys refusal to seize on the crisis as a moment to propose a radical overhaul of the economy and society.
Jon Trickett, now relegated to the backbenches from his position of shadow cabinet office minister, says: The countrys crying out for a longer-term vision. We need to map out a great vision for the kind of new normal that can exist after this pandemic. Perhaps the leadership doesnt feel nows the right time to do that.





Reynolds says those are arguments Labour can make later. For now, the priority is pressing for urgent assistance for struggling households and families. Im very sympathetic to UBI, but realistically youve got to use the channels weve got, he says.
The fact that we have come out with pragmatic suggestions of how to help people right now, does not take away from the fact that we want and are committed to a full alternative to universal credit: we want to work with people and build a big coalition around that.
That approach has been replicated across the shadow cabinet.



Annaliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, has praised the chancellors economic rescue schemes but pointed out the gaps in them. And Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, has lauded frontline police officers but demanded more action to protect domestic violence victims.
Labour believes this is what the public expects of the official opposition at a time of national crisis.
Starmer held the first two of a string of planned Call Keir virtual meetings, with voters from Bury and the Tees Valley this week.
These meetings, and polling seen by Labour strategists, are telling them the public dont want to hear knee-jerk criticism of the government. The approach were getting from the public is, All of us need to be together, getting through this, said a party source.
They also say the public believe the right time to challenge the governments handling of the outbreak head-on will be after the worst has passed  though Starmer has stepped up his attacks in the past week, telling Johnson the UK had been slow into lockdown, and now risks falling behind the rest of the world.
The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth  one of the few frontbenchers to remain in the same job when Starmer took over  has been praised by Matt Hancock for his constructive approach; but his frustration with the governments stance also appeared to bubble over this week.


The approach were getting from the public is, All of us need to be together, getting through this,

Labour party source



Ashworth has been calling for the test-and-track approach now being pursued by Hancock for some time  and believes the health secretary should have started much earlier to recruit the necessary army of contact-tracers he has now acknowledged will be needed.
This lockdown is not a strategy in itself to defeat the virus, Ashworth told the Guardian. This lockdown buys us time to put in place a strategy. And my big fear is that in the same way they failed to prepare the testing we needed, and they failed to prepare the PPE for frontline staff, it looks like they are failing to prepare the tracing capacity we need.
Most of Starmers frontbench team have been in contact with their Conservative opposite numbers, and the shadow cabinet are receiving briefings from relevant civil servants.
Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, says that while they dont want to bombard the civil service, its our job as an opposition to be constructively critical.
And Reynolds says these private conversations are no substitute for asking a question publicly, in parliament  even virtually.

Boris Johnson briefed Starmer directly this week, as part of what the prime minister claimed was part his effort to build the biggest possible consensus, for how to manage the next phase of the crisis.
Both sides insist that falls far short of coopting Labour into decision-making, however, with Starmers team regarding chatter about a national government as a Westminster bubble fantasy.



When Johnson returned to the Downing Street press conference on Thursday, he appeared to reflect Labours repeated recent calls for an exit strategy, avoiding the phrase repeatedly used by Starmer but promising a road map and a menu of options.
Speaking afterwards, Starmer made clear he felt vindicated. I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and Im pleased that were going to see a plan, well look at it when we see it, but its a step in the right direction.
With Corbyn watching from high above him on the backbenches, Starmer used a telling phrase at Wednesdays prime ministers questions, to describe how he sees his own approach  and which helps explain his caution. I try to be careful to stick to the data and the evidence, rather than just coming up with an opinion, he told Dominic Raab.","984"

On Thursday, the president met with New Jerseys governor, Phil Murphy, for a press call in which he latched on to an analogy Murphy used for coronavirus shock: As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until you get punched in the face. It makes sense that Trump would relate to Mike Tyson, said Colbert. Theyre both 80s pop culture icons with horrible histories with women who need no excuse to eat a human ear.    As for the rest of his press conferences this week, in which the president threw around words rather than guidelines, it seems Trump doesnt talk like a guy who knows what hes talking about, said Colbert. Colbert admired in particular Trumps gall to say the US will somehow be rid of the virus because it will disappear with or without a vaccine  If you dont have a vaccine and the virus is gone, were like we were before, Trump said. Oh, where we were before, good! Colbert deadpanned. So instead of being in a global pandemic, well go back to being completely unprepared for a global pandemic.   Related: Seth Meyers on Trump: 'What do they have to do to keep this guy's attention?'   Heres the thing: Trump doesnt want everything to go back to normal because were ready for it to go back to normal, Colbert concluded. He wants everything to go back to normal because hes bored. Indeed, Trump told reporters this week that hes been in the White House for months and would like to get out. Mr President, we would all like to get you out of the White House, Colbert responded. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers reacted to a truly galling BuzzFeed News report that New York state, on the direct recommendation of the White House coronavirus taskforce, paid $69.1m to a mobile-phone engineer in California who simply tweeted at Trump that he could supply ventilators. Thats three times the retail price of high-end ventilators to someone without medical device experience; not a single ventilator has been delivered on the contract. This is insane, said Meyers. I mean, were talking about a guy whos the most powerful person on Earth  theres literally a law that allows him to compel companies to make ventilators  and hes combing through his Twitter replies like hes putting a band together  Oh, this guys got an amp  well, that could come in really handy.    Meyers also rebuffed Trumps repeated claims this week that no one could have seen a pandemic coming, or that the White House has handled coronavirus well. Trump had the chance to act early, to prevent both the public health crisis and the economic one, and instead he chose to ignore and downplay the threat, Meyers said. And part of that failure is Trumps spectral son-in-law Jared Kushner, who on Wednesday told Fox and Friends that the governments response to the virus was a great success story. A great success story? Youre not even a great success story, Meyers retorted. Youre only in the White House because Ivanka lost Tom Bradys phone number in one of her sweatshop handbags. You shouldnt be anywhere near the White House; you should be confessing to Christopher Meloni at the end of an episode of Law & Order. Seriously, we have one million cases, 60,000 deaths and 30 million out of work, Meyers continued. If this is a success, what would failure look like? The Statue of Liberty getting laid off and developing a weed habit in quarantine? Trevor Noah  Apple makes its phones easier to unlock with face ID while wearing a mask, Elon Musk throws a tantrum about having to stay inside, and a Trump reply guy gets a ventilator contract via Twitter. pic.twitter.com/gajm49coqg— The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) May 1, 2020  Trevor Noah also discussed the insane story of the ventilator contract via random tweet on Thursdays Daily Social Distancing Show. First of all, if someone tells you the price of anything is $69m, its a joke  69 is pranking 101, Noah said. And second, of all, nice. Noah had to backtrack and repeat the story just to process it: Some random guy tweeted President Trump asking him for a ventilator contract, and  his wish was just granted? Just like that? He said, I want this thing, and then he got the thing? I mean, let this be a warning, Noah concluded. The next time you tweet at the president telling him that youve got Hillarys emails and deez nuts? Dont be shocked if Trump shows up to collect. Jimmy Kimmel    And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel again poked at our hungry hungry hippo-crite in chief, who spent the week saying everything is great while simultaneously blaming everyone who isnt him for why its all so terrible. Trump has been complaining that his administration inherited bad tests, which makes no sense, said Kimmel. No 1, you cant have a test for a virus before a virus exists, and No 2, hes in no position to be complaining about inheriting anything. If it wasnt for inheritance, he would be the doorman outside one of the buildings his father gave him. But if hes not moved by coronavirus and increasing unemployment, Trump gets heated about bad poll; he was reportedly so upset by his poll numbers vis-a-vis Joe Biden in swing states last week that he threatened to sue his campaign manager. Clearly, his campaign is running like a well-turmoiled machine, said Kimmel. And on Wednesday, Trump dismissed the polls outright, telling Reuters: I dont believe the polls. I believe the people of this country are smart. And I dont think theyll put a man in whos incompetent. We did it last time, why wouldnt we do it again? Kimmel responded.","936"

The move will come as welcome news to people who were forced to put their IVF treatment on hold during the crisis. Clinics across the UK can apply to reopen from 11 May, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has confirmed, if they ensure the safety and protection of staff and patients. Both private and NHS clinics will be required to show they are able to provide safe treatment during the outbreak before they are given the green light to restart. Physical distancing must be observed in waiting rooms, telephone appointments should be used when suitable and personal protective equipment used when necessary. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: Now that we are past the peak, I am delighted to announce the restoration of fertility services. People who are relying on fertility treatment have been worried during these unprecedented times not knowing when they could continue their journey to start a family. We wanted to open these clinics as soon as it was safe to do so, and our strict guidelines will ensure staff and patients remain safe as we continue to tackle this virus. HFEA, which regulates Britains fertility industry, ordered both NHS and private clinics to suspend treatment for those undergoing IVF from 15 April. Prior to this, all new IVF treatment was banned. The news caused heartache for many women desperately trying to conceive, with many fearing they could miss their chance by the time the restrictions were lifted.    Data from the HFEA showed that more than 54,000 patients underwent 75,000 fertility treatments in 2017, resulting in 20,500 births. Sally Cheshire, the HFEA chair, said: Our priority throughout the pandemic has been to consider how treatment could resume quickly and safely for as many patients as possible and our clear plan sets out how clinics can treat and care for patients safely during the continuing Covid-19 pandemic. I know that the closure of clinics has been extremely distressing for patients and this will be good news for those wanting to resume treatment and have the opportunity to try for their much longed for family.","375"

Equally important is the very use of vocabulary. One of the most popular words of the moment is unprecedented, increasingly used by politicians as if it meant unpredicted. This crisis was both predictable and predicted, as your reporting makes clear. But to imply that this pandemic was unpredictable and unpredicted relieves politicians of culpability. Other linguistic constructions have all the appearance of the beginnings of a blame game; in particular we are following the science. To think there is some single and undisputed body of knowledge and method called the science is plain wrong. But if politicians can maintain the fiction that there is something called the science and they simply follow it, then how can they be blamed? As you say, vocabulary and metaphors are not neutral constructs.Adrian DarnellDurham  The constant use of war analogies is enabling ministers to treat the public as if they were unable to grasp the risks attached to particular strategies. Talking about the coronavirus as the enemy allows the government to keep its strategy, if it has one, secret. The difference is that the virus is not like a wartime enemy; it is not listening, nor will it alter its behaviour if our strategy is publicly known. There are no spies feeding the information to the virus. The arrogance of ministers at the daily briefing, repeating over and over that they are taking the right decisions at the right time, suggests an omnipotence that they surely do not have. History will decide whether the decisions were the right ones. Right now it seems the government has no more idea what to do than anyone else, and that is why it trots out platitudes. Are they reassuring the public or themselves?Morag WatkinsBovingdon, Hertfordshire  I am starting a one-man campaign to eradicate the spread of the ramping up virus, which seems to be afflicting politicians, journalists, and anyone who comments on the Covid-19 pandemic. I yell at the radio every time Matt Hancock talks about ramping up coronavirus testing, which he does several times during the Hancocks Half Hour briefing at 5pm. Why has he abandoned the perfectly adequate verb increase? Could we start, please, with an instruction to all Guardian journalists to call out politicians who use the phrase? They themselves should pay a 100 penalty into a ramping up box each time they use it in an article. Proceeds, of course, to the NHS or social care, according to the editors choice. John Speed Luxembourg  I congratulate the Guardian for using the term physical distancing rather than the misnomer social distancing. Physical distancing actually enables some social contact.

Dr Hazel Dawe Oxford  I am ashamed of sending colleagues into mortal risk on my behalf says Dr Alan Willson (Letters, 27 April). So should we all be, particularly the government. There is an old Dutch phrase, verloren hoop which meant lost heap and referred to the soldiers who were put in the frontline of a battle in the certainty that they would die. Without PPE and all the protective gear, some of our caring staff have been treated like that lost heap.

Mubarak Bala, the president of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, was taken from his home on 28 April in neighbouring Kaduna state and taken to Kano, where a warrant for his arrest was issued, Leo Igwe, a fellow Nigerian humanist and human rights advocate, said. We condemn his arrest and are extremely worried because this came after several threats made by the religious community in Kano, Igwe said. They are likely to try him under sharia law in Kano, which could lead to capital punishment. Sharia law is applied in 12 states across the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, including Kano where blasphemy is punishable by death. Igwe said police had denied Bala access to a lawyer and had not said what the charges were, heightening fears for his safety. Our worst fear is that he would be taken to Kano because there are many figures who have been threatening him and promising to end his life, Igwe said. The Kano police told me he was in their custody, but for days now they havent given us any more information. Police in Kano would not confirm whether they were holding Bala. In a statement, Humanist UK, the leading British humanist society, said: We condemn in the strongest terms the arrest of our humanist colleague Mubarak Bala by the Nigerian authorities, who have accused him of blasphemy, which can carry the death penalty.  Nigeria is a deeply religious country, mainly Christian in the south and largely Muslim in the north. Bala, the son of a widely regarded Islamic scholar, has been an outspoken religious critic in a staunchly conservative region, where open religious dissent is uncommon. After renouncing Islam in 2014, he was forcibly committed to a psychiatric facility by his family in Kano before being discharged.  After Bala posted comments critical of Islam and religion on his Facebook profile recently he had received a surge of online accusations of blasphemy and threats, Igwe said, largely from figures in Kano. On Facebook on Monday, Bala said that after recent threats he would resort to more mildly critical posts and humour. Igwe said Bala had helped create a community for thousands of atheists, particularly in northern Nigeria. To speak out and say youre an atheist or humanist in Nigeria can be dangerous, but Bala is very passionate about creating a space for those who do not subscribe to Islam or religion, he said.

Of course, my first Test match could not be at nearby Old Trafford, home of Dads hated Lancashire, so we journeyed each day in late July by bus across the Pennines, to reach the sacred Headingley, to see England beat South Africa by 10 wickets on the third day. Andy Bull rightly celebrates the achievement that summer of Denis Compton, but how appropriate that the heroes at Headingley were Len Hutton of Yorkshire and Cyril Washbrook of Lancashire, with 100 and 75 respectively in the first innings, and both undefeated at the crease in the second, when Hutton won the match with a six over square leg.Dean HawkesCambridge  I was at Lords in 1947 to see Denis Comptons double century against South Africa in the second Test. His swagger to the wicket, his fearlessness and his sweep on one knee were a delight to behold for their novelty and courage. His partner through much of this was Bill Edrich, who was equally brave and also made over 3,000 runs in a season.

The expansion of intensive farming, mining and infrastructure around the world has contributed to diseases spreading from wildlife to people, scientists say. The 26 MPs want the government to learn this lesson and encourage better agriculture, help developing countries to halt deforestation, and provide funding for poor countries to improve their health systems. In a letter organised by Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, they ask the chancellor to provide funding, and to recognise in his economic recovery plans that human health is dependant on that of animals, plants and the environment, and to reform the financial system to protect nature. Lucas said: For too long, governments have ignored the link between the emergence of disease and climate change or biodiversity loss, failing to recognise that human health depends on the health of animals, plants and our shared environment too. If our economic system continues to push the natural world to destruction and fuel the climate emergency, we will become ever more vulnerable to future pandemics.   Related: Halt destruction of nature or suffer even worse pandemics, say worlds top scientists   The MPs are asking for environmental regulations to be strengthened and enforced, and any economic support for industries such as aviation and intensive agriculture to be conditional on environmental sustainability commitments. They also call for better funding of healthcare, and an approach to economic decision-making that takes into account health and environmental concerns, including the full costs and consequences of policies for people and nature. Their letter follows a warning last month by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity, which said recent pandemics were the direct consequence of human activity. The scientists warned: Future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today. The MPs said systems that prized economic growth above other considerations would fail to take into account the need to protect the natural environment. Lucas said: You cant negotiate with a pandemic. If were to avoid the worst in future, rebuilding our economies in the wake of Covid-19 must be on the basis of development that respects the Earths natural limits and recognises our own need for a healthy natural environment. She criticised the decision to bail out easyJet, saying that unconditional aid for industries that fuelled deforestation, destroyed natural habitats or harmed the climate would lead to problems.

The prime minister spoke on Friday afternoon to the M9  the group of mayors covering areas including Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and North Tyneside  to hear their concerns and outline the governments latest position. It is the first time Johnson has spoken directly to regional leaders since the beginning of the pandemic. Londons mayor, Sadiq Khan, is the only mayor to have attended the emergency Cobra committee meetings. Greater Manchesters mayor, Andy Burnham, has raised concerns previously about the lack of contact between central government and regional leaders, and called for more involvement and inclusion in crucial meetings. Johnson used his call to emphasise the mayors importance in the next phase of the response, and to update them on the governments strategy. Jamie Driscoll, the Labour mayor for the North of Tyne, said Johnson and the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, seemed particularly keen to get people out of their cars when the lockdown is lifted. It was very interesting that the prime minister was talking about taking the opportunity to push clean, green travel, active travel, cycling infrastructure and getting cars off the road, Driscoll said. The real risk is that you end up with a situation where people go back to work in their cars, into city centres that are not designed to take that amount of traffic, that congestion makes it harder for buses to get through and you end up with this vicious cycle.  We will be coming out of a crisis involving a virus that makes it very difficult for people to breathe. The last thing we need is a man-made equivalent. Driscoll said Johnson made the link between green travel and reducing obesity. Obesity is a massive issue and also a very expensive issue, because it does cause a lot of us, as we get older, to spend many years when we cant be that active. Its just speculation, and far be it from me to comment on the prime ministers physique, but maybe having just been through it he has had a Damascene conversion. The mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, said the message from the mayors was that all regions stand ready to play a full role in the recovery. The point is that we have got the capabilities and structures to lead our economies through this because the country works as a big set of regional economies, he said. The prime minister fully accepted that point and he gave his utter commitment to continuing the principles of levelling up and devolution as part of the way we lead our way through this recovery. The mayor of the Sheffield city region, Dan Jarvis, welcomedJohnsons commitment to work closely with mayors. We must build on these constructive discussions to ensure mayors have a strong mandate to transform our economy and society, he said. We must seize the opportunity to build a better Britain  not just recovery, but renewal. I will be working with the government and fellow mayors to deliver for our communities.

I come to work on the farm in the UK every year; I make the money for my family. Sakak said he was a bit concerned about the high rate of Covid-19 infection in the UK, but said it will probably be the same all round the world in the end. He added: I come from a tranquil village in the countryside and there is no corona there.

While the airport is open, it is missing the noise, queues and shopping opportunities we have come to expect when traveling.

A Warwickshire farmer in the arrivals hall said he was waiting to greet seven seasonal workers hired to pick vegetables. The farmer, who declined to give his name, said that if eastern European workers did not come to work in the UK this year acres of food will rot in the fields. He said it had already proved much harder than usual to hire workers this season. Only four of the seven workers he was expecting arrived.

There is more virus in the UK than Bulgaria, but my life is here, she said. I had to come back. Kotsant said she did not feel afraid during the flight despite being closely confined with lots of other people and unable to maintain a 2-metre physical distance, as advised by the government. It was fine, Kotsant said. There were no sick people on the flight, and we all wore masks. You could smell that they had just cleaned the plane. However, neither the airline nor the airports measured passengers temperatures to check for signs of fever, a key symptom of the viral infection.    The arrivals board at Luton airport.

The airline said cabin crew are required to wear masks and gloves and will distribute sanitising wipes to each passenger. Wizz Air said passengers are required to wear face masks although these would only beinitially provided by Wizz Air.

With the government set to decide next week whether to ease restrictions put in place at the end of March, the consultancy firm Capital Economics said each additional month of full quarantining would knock 1.5 percentage points off annual growth.
It said even with severe containment measures remaining in place only until the end of June and with some easing of restrictions in the coming weeks, the economy would shrink by 12% this year.
Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said there would be a much bigger hit if multiple peaks of the virus forced ministers to keep stringent measures in place until April 2021. In those circumstances, Gregory said, the economy would contract by 19.6% this year, a recession three times as severe as that which followed the global financial crisis in 2008.



   default
  


In addition, the expected bounceback in the economy would be delayed with the level of output still more than 6% below where it would have been in the absence of the pandemic by the end of 2022.
On his return to work this week, Boris Johnson said that it was too soon to ease the lockdown despite signs that physical distancing had led to a fall in the number of hospital deaths and the number of new cases of Covid-19.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent body that provides economic forecasts for the government, has pencilled in a fall of 35% in gross domestic product in the second quarter on the assumption that a full lockdown remains in place until the end of June.



   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk 
 

The OBR is assuming half the restrictions will be lifted between July and September, with the rest being removed in the final three months of the year. On that basis, output would return to its pre-crisis level by the end of the year, with an annual fall in GDP between 2019 and 2020 of more than 13%.
Gregory said she was assuming output had fallen by 25% from its pre-crisis peak during March and April, and would stagnate during May before starting to edge up in June. In the unlikely event of an immediate end to the lockdown, recovery would begin at the start of May but the economy would still shrink by 8.2% during 2020.



Gregory said that all the scenarios outlined in her report were simplified versions of what the reality is likely to be: The restrictions are unlikely to be relaxed all at once and there is already evidence that even while the economy is shut down some activity is trickling back.
She added: The longer the restrictions are in place, the longer it may take the economy to recover to pre-recession levels because of scarring effects. Indeed, in the past four recessions it took between three and five years for the economy to return to its pre-crisis level.","505"
"2020-05-01T15:42:42Z","world","World news","MPs press for sanctions against Israel over West Bank annexations","Nearly 130 parliamentarians, including former Conservative cabinet ministers, have written to Boris Johnson urging him to impose economic sanctions against Israel if Benjamin Netanyahus new coalition government goes ahead with its threat to annex parts of the West Bank. The letter, signed by the former Tory chairman Lord Patten and the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, says annexation would be clearly illegal under international law. The signatories, which also include diplomats and prominent campaigners against antisemitism in the Labour party such as Margaret Hodge, point out that the UK did not hesitate to sanction Russia after the annexation of Crimea, claiming any move in the West Bank would warrant a similar response. Netanyahu has negotiated a right to annex parts of the West Bank from 1 July in the coalition deal he signed with Benny Gantzs Kahol Lavan party, but he is thought to be waiting for approval from the Trump administration before deciding his next move. Trump wants annexation to be seen to be integrated into the peace plan set out by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, last year. Britain joined a diplomatic dmarche by 10 EU diplomats in a Zoom call this week warning the Israeli foreign ministry against annexation, but the imposition of sanctions as opposed to condemnation would be unprecedented. In the letter, organised by the Council for Arab British Understanding (Caabu), the signatories express outrage at the new Israeli governments declared plan to annex areas of territories it occupied in June 1967, describing the move as a mortal blow to the chances of peace between Israelis and Palestinians based on any viable two-state solution. They claim it is clear the Israeli government is using the cover of the Covid-19 pandemic to seek to implement this egregious plan. It is vital that the UK does everything in its power to prevent this. They argue international law is crystal clear. The acquisition of territory through war is prohibited. The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 is a recent example where Britain quite properly opposed such acts with appropriate measures, including robust sanctions. Our government has stated that any annexation cannot go unchallenged. The government must now make clear publicly to Israel that any annexation will have severe consequences including sanctions. Words are not enough: Prime Minister Netanyahu has ignored our words. We need to prevent his government from setting this alarmingly dangerous precedent in international relations. In a joint statement in September last year by the UK government, together with France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the UK warned any unilateral annexation of any part of the West Bank would be a serious breach of international law. David Jones, the chair of Caabu, said he regretfully thought Netanyahu would only listen to threats. Crispin Blunt, one of the signatories and the former chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said the issue was a massive test for the UK that he hoped his country would pass. He said he hoped Britain would take a stand by saying international law does stand for something, and bullying does not pay. Two Labour frontbenchers, Stephen Kinnock and Seema Malhotra, have signed the letter in a personal capacity, while the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has already written to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, asking him to oppose annexation.  The Israeli embassy has been contacted for comment.","556"
"2020-05-01T15:40:24Z","world","World news","Trudeau announces Canada is banning assault-style weapons","Canada has banned assault-style weapons following the murder of 22 people in the worst mass shooting in the countrys history, Justin Trudeau announced on Friday.
These weapons were designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time. There is no use and no place for such weapons in Canada, said the prime minister. Effective immediately, it is no longer permitted to buy, sell, transport, import or use military-grade assault weapons in this country.
After the Nova Scotia shooting last week, Trudeau said his government intended strengthen gun control to fulfil a campaign promise to restrict certain weapons  a plan that had initially been derailed by the coronavirus pandemic.

 Related: Twelve hours of terror: how the Nova Scotia shooting rampage unfolded 

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Tuesday that the Nova Scotia gunman, Gabriel Wortman, had been armed with two semi-automatic rifles and several semi-automatic pistols.
Supt Darren Campbell said that one of the guns could be described military-style assault rifle.
The new ban would probably not have stopped Wortman from obtaining his weapons: he did not have a license to possess or purchase firearms, and police have said they believe the guns were obtained illegally in Canada and the United States.
The prime minister announced a two-year amnesty period to allow gun owners to comply with the law. The ban covers 1,500 models and variants of firearms.
Canada has one of the highest per capita gun ownership rates in the world, at an estimated 34.7 firearms per 100 people, according to the Small Arms Survey in 2018. The country still trails far behind the US, which has close to 120 guns per 100 people.
While Trudeau promised in 2015 that a Liberal government would make it more difficult for gun owners to acquire certain types of firearms, it wasnt until the most recent election campaign that the prime minister promised a full ban on military-style assault weapons if re-elected.
As long as Canadians are losing their loved ones to gun violence, not enough has changed, Trudeau said in September. We know you do not need a military-grade assault weapon, one designed to kill the largest amount of people in the shortest amount of time, to take down a deer.
At present, the Firearms Act does not make a distinction between military-style weapons and other type of long guns  meaning the government would also need to add amend the law.
Trudeau had also previously promised to ban the Ruger Mini-14 rifle, the weapon used in the 1989 cole Polytechnique shooting in Montreal, in which 14 women were murdered.
The move to heavily restrict access to certain firearms will probably prompt anger from the opposition Conservative party and Canadas gun lobby  but a ban of certain weapons can be carried out through cabinet, bypassing the need for legislation.
Justin Trudeau is using the current pandemic and the immediate emotion of the horrific attack in Nova Scotia to push the Liberals ideological agenda to make major firearms policy changes, said the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, following Trudeaus comments. Taking firearms away from law-abiding citizens does nothing to stop dangerous criminals who obtain their guns illegally.
Ken Price, whose daughter Samantha was hurt in a 2018 mass shooting in Toronto in which two people were killed and 13 injured, said he was pleased to see movement on the issue.
Having weapons that can be configured so that they inflict massive damage just doesnt seem like the right thing to do  nor is it reflective of what the average Canadian wants, he said. And this still leaves plenty of choice for hunters, fishermen and sport shooters.
Price said Canada should also tighten controls on handguns and introduce red flag laws  enabling authorities to remove firearms from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others  but said he was pleased to see movement on assault weapons.
An overwhelming majority majority of Canadians  nearly four out of five people  support the ban, according to a poll from the Angus Reid Institute, released Friday.","667"
"2020-05-01T15:34:13Z","film","Film","I've never seen … Solaris","At university in the early 90s, friends who were studying philosophy would enthuse about Solaris in the same smoke-filled breath as Hegel and Sartre  neither of whom I had read. But I felt at ease with nerdiness, in a room crowded with techno music and people lying about on the floor. Vicariously I became a purist, without ever watching the 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky nor reading the original novel by Stanisaw Lem. And when Steven Soderberghs slicker, shorter, altogether shinier adaptation, starring George Clooney and Natasha McElhone, was released, I knowingly let it pass me by  why have Hollywood cotton when you could have Soviet silk? So it has taken me more than 25 years and the lockdown of a global pandemic to make time for Tarkovskys film, only to find that the more you attempt to understand Solaris, the more it defies explanation. Generations of scientists have risked their sanity trying to make sense of its sprawling ocean, a vast living organism that appears to be sentient; none has succeeded. The doomed hero of this story is Kris Kelvin (played by Donatas Banionis), a psychologist and expert in the field of Solaristics, who is dispatched to the station that orbits the planet to evaluate whether or not the troubled mission should continue. Its dwindling crew is under siege from mysterious figures  phantasmic incarnations of their own shameful memories and fantasies that seem to have risen up from the depths of the sea. Kelvin is greeted by devastation: his colleague Dr Gibarian has killed himself, while the other cosmonauts  Snaut and Sartorius  are hiding away in their cabins. The visitor that will drive Kelvin to the edge of madness is a simulacrum of his lost love, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who killed herself long ago. He awakes in a dream to find her sitting before him  and so the living nightmare begins.    A living nightmare  Solaris. Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy Stock Photo   Or, at least, this is where the film really gets going. Departing from the book, Tarkovsky opens on Earth. Entrancing images of the natural world  a leaf carried downstream, weeds undulating in the dark depths of a brook, thistles veiled in light mist  are set to the melancholic sound of an organ work by Bach (a musical embodiment of order, religious faith and reason) as Kelvin contemplates the garden at his family home. It is an exquisite conjuring of the universe he is preparing to leave behind, as well as a vision of lost childhood that reproduces the house the director grew up in. Tarkovsky is on home ground, then, yet uncannily so, as home, in that disturbing Wizard of Oz way, becomes somewhere yearned for, yet forever beyond reach. A similar meditation on nature occurs in Tarkovskys later science fiction film, Stalker, a journey through a post-apocalyptic wasteland called the Zone in search of a mythical house of dreams. And perhaps it was the remnants of the industrial landscape from that film that made me imagine the characters of Solaris would be trapped between brutalist grey walls in a dystopian black-and-white vision of solitude. We do get stark white interiors when Kelvin arrives in space, but this vision of the future is not so distant from the films present; he wears the same clothes he wore on Earth  a leather jacket and T-shirt (that bears an unfortunate passing resemblance to a string vest)  while his pyjamas really are monogrammed. Mirrors in each room reflect the cosmonauts journey into his interior world. Objects are imbued with memories: Bruegels The Hunters in the Snow hangs on the wood-panelled walls of the library, recalling the cold comforts of the earthly landscape hes left behind. But return to that moment when the narrator, Kelvin, meets Hari in the book: My first thought was: Im glad this is one of those dreams where you know youre dreaming. All the same, Id preferred her not to be there. I closed my eyes and began to wish this intensely, but when I opened them again she was still sitting there. What I love is the way in which the film captures this merging of dreams and the waking world. Emerging eerily out of silence, the ambient sounds of Eduard Artemyevs electronic score echo the warm glow of red sunlight that floods the room and catches soft hairs lining the contours of Haris face.   Related: I've never seen2001: A Space Odyssey   Elsewhere, surreal happenings (a dwarfs darting out from Sartoriouss cabin as he guards his door) or telling inconsistencies (the lack of fastener on Haris dress) go unexplained, occurring naturally within the rhythm and pace of an elliptical chain of events. As the camera slowly pans in long takes, characters that disappear from one point of view seem to occupy an entirely different space when seen from another, creating the effect of a lucid dream in which the camera is at once observing and determining the narrative. Bondarchuk is disconcertingly blank-faced and willing as she relives the traumatic loops of obsessive love that destroyed her; Banionis convincingly carries the burden of guilt of a man whose first desperate attempt to get rid of the problem involves folding her into a rocket and launching her into space. Relating was clearly never his strong point. But what to make of it all? Im still none the wiser. Tarkovsky set out to expose the phoniness of Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey with this interrogation of the human condition and the result is a strange kind of psychological horror. The vividly coloured and intricately textured forms of Lems majestically rendered ocean  so profoundly unsettling in the novel  are almost an afterthought here. Soderberghs sea at least gives off a nice CGI shimmer in a telling that ticks off Lems underlying philosophical queries with impressive efficiency. (Questions of faith, the existence of God and the limitations of human understanding are raised and dealt with in the exchanges of a 30-second dinner party conversation.) But, in the absence of CGI, and a musical score that tells you how to feel, Tarkovskys dreamworld draws you in; you dont need an ocean to sense a world at sea.","1015"
"2020-05-01T15:32:40Z","commentisfree","Opinion","Trump is handling coronavirus so badly, he almost makes Johnson look good","This government should be on the rack. The evidence that it botched crucial decisions at crucial moments is piling up. The litany is now so familiar it barely needs repeating, from the failure to secure personal protective equipment for frontline workers in health and social care to the 11 lost days of delay before imposing a lockdown that has proved essential for saving lives. You can focus on specific judgments: why did ministers allow mass gatherings, from racing at Cheltenham to a Stereophonics gig in Cardiff, ignoring the warnings that such events would be a virus-fest? Why did it initially tell people to stay away from pubs and restaurants, but simultaneously allow those places to stay open? Why did the government call a halt in March to testing and tracing? If the answer is a lack of capacity, then why did it not immediately set about recruiting the army of contact tracers that will be required if we are ever to emerge from our homes? Why the focus on mega-labs, rather than seizing on the offer of small laboratories to do testing for their local hospitals, which, as Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, has argued, could have made those hospitals safe places? Why the rules initially limiting tests to those NHS employees with symptoms, which, as Nurse puts it, allowed staff to be on wards infecting people? Or you can look at decisions going back a decade, pointing a finger at Tory austerity that starved public services to the bone, leaving them underequipped and eroding our resilience. Either way, the country now faces a death toll approaching 30,000. And yet, far from being on the rack, the government continues to bask in public support. True, approval for the governments handling of the crisis has fallen from the dizzying 61% it reached a month ago to 51% at last count. But 51% is still the kind of approval rating most politicians long for. What accounts for this disconnect between the governments record and the publics high regard for those responsible? Put another way, why isnt Boris Johnson in more trouble? Any answer must begin with what pollsters call the rally-around-the-flag effect, the tendency for voters to back their leaders in a time of crisis. Data from around the world, in this era and in others, suggests that when citizens are scared, they want to believe those in charge have the wisdom and strength to protect them. Think of electorates as passengers on a plummeting plane: in that moment of peril, they need to trust the pilot. In Johnsons case, theres an additional factor. No one can throw at him the traditional accusation directed at politicians, namely that he is out of touch with the seriousness of the disease. His own near-death experience with Covid-19 immunises him from that charge. The outpouring of sympathy while he clung to life in intensive care was real; some of it lingers when he briefs the nation from No 10 and grows visibly tired before the hour is up. That might prompt some voters to go a bit easier on the prime minister than they otherwise would, an indulgence buttressed by the arrival this week of a Downing Street baby. The extraordinary month Johnson has endured acts to protect the prime minister and, since this is very much his administration, the entire government. Hes helped, too, by the fact that there is so little we know for certain about this disease. The UK may have the highest death rate in Europe, but as David Spiegelhalter argued persuasively, we wont be sure of that until the end of the year, and the years after that. Even if Britain does turn out to be the worst hit, itll be easy to argue that it wasnt the governments fault but was rather a function of certain immovable facts about this country: that, for example, it includes a city, London, that has no direct European equivalent in size or scale. Some voters are surely minded to give the government the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that it has merely been following the science. That could prove a valuable alibi, nicely positioning the scientists as the fall guys once all this is done. Even those who know that when it comes to public health policy there is no such thing as the science  that there are always going to be competing views over how to act on data once youve got it  could see that as a reason to cut ministers some slack: faced with a near-unprecedented threat, politicians have had to make life-and-death decisions with no clear manual to follow. It helps that much of the press is supportive, putting the Johnson baby news or Capt Tom Moore on the front and condemning the dead to the inside pages. Its handy, too, to have a few outriders attacking journalists for daring to ask awkward questions at a time like this, suggesting they should be biting their tongues in the spirit of national unity (when, of course, asking awkward questions of those in power is journalists essential duty). Nor does it hurt to have an opposition that  for reasons that may make sound political sense  has decided to offer mild, constructive criticism rather than to put the boot in. All of these factors have helped insulate the government from the flak that would otherwise be coming its way. But theres one more, perhaps less obvious explanation  and it relates to judgment by comparison. We dont need to wait for a full statistical analysis to know that Johnson has not been the worst world leader in this crisis, because we can declare a winner in that contest right now. Each day Britons wake up to ever more jaw-dropping news from across the Atlantic. Last week, it was Donald Trump advising Americans to inject bleach. On Friday, it was his claim to have seen evidence that coronavirus was developed in a Wuhan laboratory, a claim denied by his own director of national intelligence. The shocking images of protesters wielding assault weapons storming into the state assembly in Michigan on Thursday night are hardly a surprise, given that Trump himself was tweeting Liberate Michigan! a matter of days ago, cheering on those who are demanding their states defy the advice of Trumps own White House and prematurely end the lockdown that has so far proved to be the only way to stop the virus. However bad Johnson and his government of conspicuously few talents is, we know theyre not that. They can at least show a modicum of human empathy for those whove lost loved ones, a feat that continues to elude Trump. They have at least  eventually  united behind a coherent stay home message, rather than undermining that advice at every turn. They are not hawking quack cures and endorsing deranged conspiracy theories. They do not seem willing to countenance mass death in the insane belief that it will help them win an election. Its a low bar, but these are low times.  Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist","1183"

Sinn Fins spokesperson on agriculture, Brian Stanley, told the Irish parliament last night that 120 workers at the Rosderra Meats plant in Roscrea had tested positive for the virus. He also said that of 350 workers at the plant, up to 140 were off sick last week. Rosderra is the largest pork-processing company in Ireland. Michael Creed, Irelands agriculture minister, told MPs that he was aware of six meat-processing plants with two or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 among workers, although he did not name them.   Related: Millions of farm animals culled as US food supply chain chokes up    A spokesperson for Rosderra Meats confirmed to the Guardian that a number of employees had tested positive for coronavirus. They said that the company had implemented stringent measures to ensure the safety of employees, and added that production will be scaled down until all staff return to work.  The news came as one of Irelands biggest beef companies announced a Covid-related shutdown. Dawn Meats said on Friday that it had temporarily closed its plant in Westmeath after four workers tested positive for coronavirus. Dawn Meats produces more than 400 million burgers a year for McDonalds outlets in the UK and Europe. In a statement, the company said that the plant had been closed out of an abundance of caution. It has yet to decide if it will reopen next week. Workers at other meat plants, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said they were frightened of contracting the virus, and expressed deep concern that social distancing is not being enforced on some factory floors. One said that people are on top of each other, its like a cattle mart. A complaint made to a line manager was ignored, they say.   People are on top of each other, its like a cattle mart  Anonymous meat plant worker     The closure has raised deep concerns that Irelands export-driven agri-food sector will be severely hit by the pandemic. Agri-food is the most important domestic industry in the country, employing more than 170,000 people. Produce is exported to more than 180 countries and the sector is worth 14bn (12.3bn) to the economy. The US, another country where the meat industry is a vital economic component with a powerful lobby, has been hit so hard by coronavirus-related closures that President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order to keep meat plants open. There are fears that prices and supply may be seriously disrupted. In Northern Ireland, union representatives are pushing owners to undertake full health and safety risk assessments at meat plants, following concerns that factories are not putting workers safety first. Companies are not enforcing social distancing and definitely not providing enough PPE, said Brian Hewitt of Unite, who said he was aware of positive cases of the virus in workers at meat plants in Armagh and Tyrone. Workers are afraid of getting infected, he said.  In March, workers at the poultry processor Moy Park in Portadown walked out over fears that the company was putting employees at risk of infection. Sean McKevitt of Unite, who represents the workers, said on Friday that following negotiations with the company there was an improved picture for staff at Moy Parks Dungannon and Portadown plants. Social distancing was in place, and workers had secured an additional 30 a week payment.

As a grande dame humanist, her style of campaigning, like her prose and her conversation, was direct and uncompromising. In 1989 she stood in front of a demonstration of Muslims calling for the death of Salman Rushdie with a simple placard saying Free Speech, and she remained firm even as she was physically attacked. She was a regular at Speakers Corner in London and at debates and podiums around the world, including on speaking tours across the US and India. Barbara was born in Catford, south London, to Roman Catholic parents, Gilbert Smoker, a trader in clothing, and his wife, Amy (nee Morris). She had a convent education and as a child had intended to be either a nun or a devotional author. However, when she reached the age of 18 during the second world war she went to serve in the Womens Royal Naval Service in south-east Asia from 1942 to 1945, and after the war she made a living through secretarial work. In 1949, at the age of 26, the realisation that she was a humanist and no longer a Catholic suddenly struck her on a visit to the philosophy section of a public library  a moment, she told me, that was like an enormous orgasm. In the 1950s she became a member of the Ethical Union (now Humanists UK) and the South Place Ethical Society, based at Conway Hall in London, and for the rest of her life devoted herself to advancing the cause of humanism. Any concept of a conventional working career took a back seat to that preoccupation, and for most of the time Barbara survived by taking on temporary jobs, often secretarial in nature, while also generating cash through writing articles, entering and winning competitions in magazines and gambling on the horses. Of necessity, and of choice, she always lived frugally. Eventually Barbara became president of the National Secular Society in 1972, and she held that post until 1996, representing the atheist viewpoint in print, on lecture platforms, on speaking tours, and on radio and television. Her book Humanism, commissioned as one of a series for school religious education courses, was published in 1973 and is still in print today. Her collected articles for the Freethinker magazine were published in 2002. She was also chair of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (now Dignity in Dying) from 1981 to 1985, and supported many other causes and movements, including for nuclear disarmament, abolition of the death penalty, prison reform, decriminalisation of abortion, and gay rights. Her memoirs were published in 2018 as My Godforsaken Life. She was a contented person, unencumbered by material possessions or regrets, but loved and supported by a wide array of nephews and nieces  the one advantage, she once told me, of her Catholic origins.","491"

Anyone found carrying out FGM will face up to three years in prison, according to a document seen by the Guardian. The council of ministers approved the new law on 22 April, but it still needs to be passed by members of the sovereign council, which was created following the ousting of former dictator Omar al-Bashir. Amira Azhary, from the National Council for Child Welfare and a campaigner for the Saleema initiative, which campaigns for an end to the practice, said: We expect that the law will be passed by the sovereign council and if that happens, it will be an expression of the political will in this country.   Related: True numbers of FGM victims could be far higher as countries fail to record cases   Sudan has one of the highest rates of FGM in the world. According to the UN, 87% of Sudanese women have undergone the practice. Girls are usually cut between the ages of five and 14. However, because the practice is entrenched in Sudanese culture, activists expect it will take a long time to be eradicated entirely. There is so much work to be done. This is a start, a good start, said Fatma Naib, communication officer of the UN childrens agency, Unicef, in Sudan. The crucial step will be to ensure there are consequences for those who perform the cut on their girls. Some states in the country banned FGM a few years ago, but attempts to ban it nationally were not successful under Bashir. Sudanese women along with the Egyptians and Somalis have been leading the fight against FGM, said Nimco Ali, a leading anti-FGM activist who heads up the Five Foundation, a global partnership to end the practice. Sudanese women have always wanted to end FGM. Sudan took the same path as Egypt politically  and that means women can also lead and be part of the transitional government. The UKs international development secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, tweeted: In our turbulent world, fantastic to see the new government in #Sudan outlawing female genital mutilation. There is no place for #FGM in the 21st century. Baroness Sugg, the UKs special envoy for girls education, tweeted: This is a vital step towards a world where every girl is safe. FGM involves the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons. The UN estimates that 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM in 31 countries  27 of which are in Africa. However, a report published in March said the number could be much higher as the practice is carried out in more than 90 countries, many of which do not collect data. World leaders have pledged to eliminate FGM by 2030.","448"

"2020-05-01T15:00:02Z","world","World news","US germ warfare research leads to new early Covid-19 test","Scientists working for the US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, the Guardian has learned.
In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the viruss presence as early as 24 hours after infection  before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus.
The test has emerged from a project set up by the US militarys Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week.
The concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide, the head of Darpas biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be absolutely a gamechanger.



   default
  


While pre-infectious detection would improve the efficiency of test-and-trace programmes as governments worldwide relax lockdowns, Darpa cautioned that it must wait until after FDA approval is given and the test can be put into practise for evidence of exactly how early it can pick up the virus.
The goal of research is to develop and validate an early host blood response diagnostic test for Covid, Prof Stuart Sealfon, who leads the research team at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, said in an email.
He said the testing approach, which looks at the bodys response as it fights Covid-19, should produce earlier results than current nose-swab tests that hunt for the virus itself. Because the immune response to infection develops immediately after infection, a Covid signature is expected to provide more sensitive Covid infection diagnosis earlier, he told the Guardian.
The research behind the development of the tests will eventually be made public, with the collaborating teams from medical schools at Mount Sinai, Duke University and Princeton expected to publish online, allowing scientists around the world to trial similar methods.
If EUA is granted, the test should start being rolled out in the US in the second half of May. Approval is not guaranteed, but Darpa scientists are enthusiastic about the potential impact as governments loosen lockdowns amid worries about controlling potential second-wave outbreaks.



   default
  


We are all extremely excited. We want to roll this test out as quickly as we can, but at the same time share with others who might want to implement in their own countries, said Dr Eric Van Gieson, who set up Darpas epigenetic characterization and observation (Echo) programme last year to diagnose biological warfare victims, and has redirected it to focus on Covid-19. Epigenetics looks at a set of controls on genes that can respond to the environment.
Hope that the test might pick up carriers before they become infectious is based on previous research into other viruses, though Sealfon said this remained unknown for Covid-19.
We have evidence that diagnosis happens in the first 24 hours for influenza and an adenovirus, Van Gieson said. We are still in the midst of proving that with Covid-19. That said, we should know very soon after EUA. He sees potential for the US to carry out up to a million tests a day, starting with 100,000 daily in May.
The test would up the possibility of isolating pre-infectious cases and closing down transmission chains. It could also dramatically reduce quarantine periods for people exposed to Covid-19 spreaders, allowing them to go back to work within days. It could have exceptional demand, said Chris Linthwaite, the chief executive of Fluidigm, a California life-sciences technology company that is part of the project, who believes frequent testing can help manage workforces as they return to offices, warehouses and factories.
The UK government announced plans two weeks ago to restart a contact-tracing programme that was abandoned early in the outbreak. Britains stated target was 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. France announced on Tuesday that it would test 700,000 people a week, including those without symptoms.
Other countries such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand already have efficient tracing systems, but they would be boosted if carriers could be detected early.







Darpa experts also see potential to improve protocols for protecting health care workers and others in high-risk jobs, as well as those in relatively self-contained or isolated communities such as care homes and prisons or onboard ships.
The test uses the same polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines used for checking nasal swabs from people suspected of having the virus. Its a simple tweak, said Van Gieson. The infrastructure is already there. 
Limitations on use are similar to those already faced by countries such as Britain and depend on PCR capacity, stocks of chemical reagents and logistics. Results can take an hour, or longer if samples must be sent away to laboratories.
Like the viral test, the new blood test hunts for a type of molecule called RNA. In this case it is messenger RNA (mRNA). Target mRNA is part of the immune response to viral infection, Sealfon said. mRNA expression levels really do adjust due to the presence of Covid-19. Understanding the immune response is key to fighting Covid-19.
Covid-19 is thought to incubate for about five days, at which stage people are assumed to become infectious. That is also when the virus can be detected by current nose swab tests. They do the job, they just dont tell you someone is sick until maybe four days after this [new test], said Van Gieson.
The research shows accuracy levels above 95%. This is something that will need to be constantly monitored as it will inevitably change up or down, Van Gieson said.
Blood samples are harder to collect than nose swabs, but may be more reliable. Swab testing can be difficult because it requires taking a sample from deep inside the nose.
It can throw up a lot of false negatives, said Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University, adding that recent studies showing low reliability were probably due to poor swab sampling. Ive been very concerned by pictures on the television of drive-in testing. Something you could measure reliably in blood could be a good thing.



Like all researchers contacted by the Guardian, however, he was unwilling to comment further until the Mount Sinai-led team published its research. Most were concerned about potential problems with accuracy and practicality. Blood collection is a potential limitation, since drive-in centres are not usually equipped to do this. One millilitre of blood  a fifth of a teaspoon  is needed.
The research team is expected to publish the mRNA sequence, allowing others to create the so-called primer required. A similar approach was taken when the genetic sequence of the virus itself was released by China in January, allowing tests to be developed rapidly in South Korea and elsewhere.","1193"

Hurray! The football season is back! Six hundred years after the last match, everyones favourite sport has returned in the style we have come to know and follow with ill relish. And its all thanks to the French government, whose decision to ban team japes until September has kicked off the biggest hoohah since 2010, when Les Bleus decided it was simply impossible to envisage playing the World Cup so long as their manager spoke in a brusque tone.

 Related: Amiens vow to fight Ligue 1 relegation after 'injustice' of season resolution 

Following their governments decree, the French league declared the season over and then confirmed the standings after 28 matches (27 in some cases) as the final table. That sealed a fairytale title triumph for the Embassy of Qatar, and Big Cup qualifications for Marseille and Rennes. But it also condemned Lyon to missing out on European competition for the first time in 24 years, and the clubs overlord, Jean-Michel Aulas, says thats a bowl of sick he wont swallow. This is robbing us of an opportunity that is very significant, of high value, he howled before vowing to deploy a crack squad of lawyers in an eat-this-mofos formation. We are going to claim damages worth several dozen million euros, stormed Aulas, scratching his nails down a chalkboard. Nol Le Grat has to face the consequences as president of the FFF. His management here was poor. There were poorly thought-out decisions.
Aulas had proposed alternative ways of determining the final standings, including play-offs whenever, and pointed out that Lyon have a habit of finishing seasons strongly. A similar claim was made by the president of Amiens, who have been consigned to relegation. Since our non-league days our success has always been built on our finishes to the season, declared Bernard Joannin, the head of a club who had hope of survival despite being on a 13-match winless run. I will go to the end to uphold our rights because I am a warrior. There were still 30 points up for grabs and we were just four below Nmes! Football has shown a lack of humanity with this decision. The only way to restore humanity, as everyone knows, is to call in the lawyers.

Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice had just had two big successes with Joseph and Jesus Christ Superstar, and I was the golden boy of the West End at that point. So somebody had the bright idea of bringing the three of us together to adapt the stories of PG Wodehouse. It was doomed from the start. People were jumping on board with no previous experience. It was a case of the blind leading the blind. Tim had cold feet and Andrew said I could be the lyricist  piece of cake. I remember thinking Hammerstein and Gershwin would be turning in their graves. We had this idea that David Wood (playing Bingo Little) would be on a chandelier swinging around, but found out he gets the most appalling vertigo. He got up on his toes and he started screaming, so we had to abandon it. I wrote something that was enormously long and we never actually did a run-through. The first performance went on and on and on. The musicians had a four-hour call, so once we got to the four-hour mark, they all trailed out and went to the pub. The poor conductor very gallantly ran for the piano and played the last number, but with the cast not being operatically trained, they were completely thrown once theyd lost their harmonies. There was a lot of slamming of seats. We made ruthless cuts and staggered on. It never got any better. I cut some ballet sequences and the choreographer walked out. Come first night, Andrew said: Are you going to sit in? I said: No, I dont think so. We went to a club round the corner and came back at the end. Apparently the audience had been booing. The rest of the cast had fled. We went to see David Hemmings, who was playing Bertie Wooster, who we heard was still in his dressing room. He was crying and sitting in the shower so I stepped in to get to him and told him it was all our fault. I was soaking wet, it was like a farce. It ran for another three sad weeks and got universally awful reviews. I said that was my lot as far as musicals are concerned. The next thing I did was Bedroom Farce, no songs at all.    Suddenly it was scary  Lynn Nottage. Photograph: Michael Zorn/Invision/AP   Ever been spanked on the derrire? Lynn Nottage on PorKnockers (1995) I still remember an audience member ripping up their programme into tiny shreds and throwing it like confetti, saying: I am cancelling my subscription to the theatre! PorKnockers is a social satire about a group of radical idealists who blow up a building and inadvertently kill some children who are playing inside. I wrote it after working for Amnesty International for a number of years, when the world felt topsy-turvy. It was originally staged at Dance Theatre Workshop in London, and was immensely successful. As a result, a production was planned at the Vineyard theatre in 1995. Then the world changed. Timothy McVeigh blew up an FBI building in Oklahoma, killing hundreds of people, including children. Prior to this, it was seen as what it was  a satire  and people were able to laugh. Back then, at least in the US, terrorism wasnt something that really touched us on a regular basis. Once we were faced with the reality, the play could not be received in the same way. Suddenly this social satire became really scary. There would have been more backlash if more people saw it, but few came because it was so badly reviewed. Its never been redone. I was sued by someone who claimed I had stolen his idea at a reading, but he didnt realise my show had been staged a whole year before his reading. And why would I steal an idea thats gone so badly? But the strangest thing was I started getting prank phonecalls from this German man who said he had seen the play, loved it, and was writing a PhD on theatre of cruelty. We began discussing it and then in a whisper he said: Have you ever been spanked on the derrire with a ping-pong paddle? And I was like: Excuse me? I hung up but he kept calling me for six months.

April De Angelis on A Laughing Matter (2002) There arent many jobs where you can have 10 or so people publicly saying things about something you hold dear, something you have spent your whole life doing. But the only way a playwright ever learns is to write a play and put it on. I wrote A Laughing Matter in 2002. It was a play about David Garrick, the 18th-century theatrical all-rounder, putting on Oliver Goldsmiths She Stoops to Conquer. The idea was that Out of Joint would tour Goldsmiths play and have a new play written to accompany it. I decided to write a story of how She Stoops to Conquer came to be. It was originally refused by Garrick because he felt it was too crude. It had good audiences, but it just didnt get well reviewed. One critic  actually it was the Guardians Michael Billington  said it was an inaccurate rendering of Garricks life, even though it was never meant to be accurate. It was supposed to be comic! We dont know the facts, he never wrote his life down. And why cant you write a slightly imagined history? I think Ive written good plays and bad plays. The good tend to survive, the bad dont. This was the only play where Id put my hand on my heart and say: Thats a good play, that should survive. And it hasnt. Any writer can tell you every bad thing thats been written about them. I went through a phase of going: Im not reading the reviews. But then Id just grab my phone and ask: What are they saying? We need critics and sometimes bad comments are justified, but that one I just couldnt. Im still cross. Web critics got it. Broadsheet ones didnt Anthony Neilson on Narrative (2013) Our idea of stories is evolving in the digital age.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian   I think my show Narrative was a reasonably successful attempt at changing the mainstream. It was performed upstairs at the Royal Court in London, and a lot of the younger web critics really got it but the old-school broadsheet ones didnt. I dont think it was some genius, amazing work, but it opened a dialogue that was worth having. And thats all I want to do: think about what a mainstream new form of narrative might be in theatre. Something that moves in a different way and will make sense to people 20 or 50 years from now. If you look at the history of film, it changes somewhat in terms of peoples cognition. It has some feeling of response. I dont see the same things happening in theatre, which means that 20 or 30 years down the line when this demographic  who the industry is so eager to cater for and who can afford to pay 100 for a ticket  is gone, Im not sure where theyre going to get their audiences from. Im finding myself pretty disillusioned by theatre. You can only make lots of money if youre prepared to write adaptations of films.

"2020-05-01T14:41:45Z","music","Music","Tony Allen: the Afrobeat maverick who blazed a trail across the globe","Few musicians can claim to have invented a revolutionary rhythm, but then few are quite like the late Afrobeat pioneer Tony Allen. Brian Eno called him the greatest drummer that ever lived, citing his style alongside James Browns funk breakbeat and the constant pulse of German band Neu! as the three great beats of the 1970s. Allens swirl of jazz, Yoruba and highlife was unlike anything the world had ever heard: a full-body polyrhythmic workout that would give most drummers sore wrists just thinking of it. Allen came to prominence in Lagos alongside Fela Kuti. He started drumming in the late 50s while working at a radio station, looking to jazz icons such as Art Blakey and Max Roach for inspiration as he taught himself to play. In 1964 he met Kuti and they spent the next half-decade fine-tuning their fusion of west African party music and American funk and jazz, in the bands Koola Lobitos and, by 1969, Africa 70. While Kuti, who died in 1997, is more well-known than his musical soulmate, he said that without Tony Allen there would be no Afrobeat.   Related: Tony Allen: the Afrobeat pioneer's 10 finest recordings   Allen has always said he didnt invent Afrobeat per se, but his drumming was the genres backbone. He was a machine behind the kit, his method providing the foundation for Kutis fancies. Allens was a physical, multi-limbed approach. He thought drumming should be akin to riding a bicycle, as he told the Wire magazine. You have to use your four limbs, he said, which was very rare among drummers when he was starting out: Maximum was three. Its little wonder Kuti said that Allen did the work of five drummers, though Allen went one further. When Im in a happy mood playing, you can hear me like six drummers, he said in one interview. On some days it could be 100! Guardian critic Robin Denselow called his style constantly inventive yet never flashy  dominant, but never intrusive. Although perhaps Allen would disagree with the flashy part  he once told Clash magazine: I want people to hear my drums, I want my drums to sound like a piano. You have to hear different things at the same time, like a chord.    Allen performing in Paris, 7 February 2015. Photograph: SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock   For Allen, music was the most important message. He became notorious for his all-night sessions at Kutis club, the Shrine, where Brazilian legends Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela and even Stevie Wonder would show up to jam. When Kutis compound Kalakuta Republic was raided by armed troops in 1977, Allen was on stage at the Shrine, lost in the groove. A year later, frustrated by Kutis increasingly erratic behaviour (you name it: his 27 wives, paranoia, political agitation, refusal to pay his band members), he quit Africa 70 and went his own way. He briefly relocated to London and then, in the mid-80s, to France, where he spent the first few years kicking a heroin habit. Throughout the 90s he kept working: as a session player for the likes of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Manu Dibango. But by the end of the decade, Allen had come into his own. At the turn of the millennium, France was credited as bringing back Afrobeat and creating the future of fusion. The producers and selectors that he met in Paris, such as Frederic Galliano and particularly Doctor L, stoked his experimental spirit. On his 1999 album Black Voices, Allen teamed up with Doctor L to bring dub and electronica into the fray. They worked together again on 2001s Psyco on Da Bus. Meanwhile the UK Afro-centric reissue label Strut released his first four albums: Jealousy (1975), Progress (1977), No Accommodation for Lagos (1979) and No Discrimination (1979). From there, Allen entered the pop fray, working with French electro-pop artist Sbastien Tellier on the album Politics, and its standout song La Ritournelle, and Charlotte Gainsbourg in 2007.   Related: Tony Allen, legendary drummer and Afrobeat co-founder, dies aged 79   Allen worked with artists as varied as Detroit techno innovator Jeff Mills, Malian singer Oumou Sangar, South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela, Grace Jones and Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But his best-known musical partnership since Kuti came with Damon Albarn. The Blur singer namechecked him on the bands 2000 track Music Is My Radar (Tony Allen really got me dancing) and the pair struck up a kinship that lasted a decade, on The Good, the Bad & the Queens eponymous 2007 album and again for 2018s Merrie Land. As with Kuti, Allen has said that the supergroups music was written after he had supplied his drum patterns; he also joined Albarns travelling cohort of contemporary and trad African musicians, Africa Express, in 2012. There is no doubt Allen was intrigued by the music of the future, but he was also fervent about keeping the spirit of Afrobeat alive and passing his knowledge on to the next generation.

"2020-05-01T14:39:30Z","commentisfree","Opinion","Aggressive testing and pop songs: how Vietnam contained the coronavirus","As of 30 April, Vietnam has a coronavirus death count of zero and only 270 cases. While the mortality numbers climb into the hundreds of thousands across the world, Vietnam has managed to contain the outbreak of coronavirus through timeliness, aggressive infection control, mass mobilisation of its population and an unprecedented level of openness. Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnams successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On 28 January, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus. In the following weeks, Vietnam continuously imposed restrictions and issued policies ahead of and sometimes against the WHOs recommendations, such as a series of international travel bans and the compulsory wearing of face masks. In late January, the WHO was advising against international traffic restrictions  and to this day, it still stands by the recommendation that face masks are not necessary for the general public. Due to limited treatment infrastructures, the Vietnamese government has focused on mass testing and aggressive contact tracing  a tactic it had employed to fight Sars 17 years ago. Only this time on a larger scale. As of 30 April, Vietnam had conducted 261,004 tests and put tens of thousands of people in isolation. Testing and contact tracing is based on a four-level principle announced by the health ministry: confirmed Covid-19 patients and their direct contacts (level 1: isolation and treatment in hospitals); close contacts with level 1 (level 2: quarantine facilities); close contacts with level 2 (level 3: self-quarantine at home); and lockdown of the neighbourhood/village/town where the patient lives (level 4). Adhering to this principle has meant testing a massive number of suspected cases for every new patient. So far, Vietnam has tested nearly 800 people for each new confirmed case, the highest ratio in the world, according to Reuters data. Vietnam was able to make its own test kits and has even exported the kits to Europe and the US. In real life, this scale of testing is easier said than done. Vietnam has gone to great lengths to locate the virus, even utilising methods that could have been controversial in countries with stricter privacy rights. It publishes a detailed travel history of every new patient on social media and in local newspapers in order to seek people who have been in close contact with them. To increase vigilance, the government has also released a mobile app for people to alert the authority about suspected infections in their area. For all people entering the country, a health declaration is now compulsory, with criminal penalties for false declarations. Some would claim these measures are intrusive and would doubt their effectiveness if implemented elsewhere. This may be true. Vietnam is a one-party state with decades of experience in mobilising its population through wars, Sars and swine flu outbreaks. In the early days of the epidemic, the government framed the outbreak as a war. Doctors and nurses were referred to as soldiers, and the newly formed National Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control was dubbed the General Headquarters  a reference back to a military body in existence until 1975. Not only has the language of war been revived, the military has been central to tackling the outbreak. It has been in charge of coordinating the food, transport and accommodation required to quarantine thousands of people returning home to Vietnam from outbreak zones such as the UK. As in wartime, almost every sector, including aviation, healthcare and food production, has been mobilised and dedicated to containing the pandemic. Citizens, meanwhile, are encouraged via social media, text messages and TV broadcasts to donate to the nations disease prevention funds. These messages have not been communicated in a rigid militaristic style. Instead, the government has been creative. It updates citizens via regular text messages and has teamed up with two famous pop singers to produce an educational song about the virus, commissioned artists to create posters, and used young, influential figures to broadcast positive messages to those under mandatory quarantine. These creative messages have resonated with many living in lockdown. Vu Dinh Thai, a 25-year-old Vietnamese graduate student in the UK, spent nearly a month in the governments quarantine camp. Despite unhygienic water and limited access to the internet, he was grateful for the safety he couldnt be assured of in the UK. Its free and they tried their best, he told me via text messages, and who would belittle their country for being poor? Vietnam made it clear at the beginning of the pandemic that it wanted to protect its reputation as a safe country. Yet by being open with its people, the government has achieved more than just safeguarding its image; it has rebuilt public trust. For the past few years, Vietnam has had to deal with protests over non-transparent handling of environmental disasters such as a mass fish poisoning in 2016, land disputes, and most recently a controversial bill of special economic zones. The question is whether Vietnam can retain this level of transparency in the aftermath of the crisis. Respecting and being open with the people can only benefit Vietnam.

"2020-05-01T14:29:17Z","commentisfree","Opinion","How will we choose 10 people for our social bubble – without falling out with everyone?","Who is the so-called bubble policy for, exactly? I first heard about it when it floated out of Belgium a couple of weeks ago. The idea is that the end of lockdown would start with everyone being allowed to socialise once a week, in groups of up to 10 (although it would always have to be the same group). This is separate, by the way, to the idea that burst, rather surprisingly, out of Switzerland a week later  that since children under 10 were not considered infectious, adults should be allowed to hug them. Brilliant idea. You could just park a nine-year-old in the street, and everyone would hug it. But what if they dont want to be hugged? said my niece in horror, and I was all: Chill, youre 12. The Belgian idea, on the other hand, sounded genuinely mad. Until, that is, it turned out that, after it was pre-briefed, or semi-briefed, to the media, it is also to be our own governments bright idea. I am way past the point of being able to tell which rumour is true. But it seems safest to assume that the worst possible thing is the one that will happen, so we could soon need to start arranging ourselves in units of 10. I was talking to a friend about it (honestly, I was not sizing her up, but since you mention it, at a family size of three, with good age-compatibility across the generations, they wouldnt be a bad fit if they lived in the same town). Id have to have my own family in the group, she said. I thought about this for a bit. I would happily gatecrash her wider family. But whys that her choice? Id never make anyones 10, she said. Of course you would. I wouldnt. Nobody ever calls me. Im calling you right now. A pause. I pressed on: You can be in my 10. A really long pause. Wait, I said. You dont want to be in my 10? Another goddamn pause! I cant believe you! Youre not worried about rejection at all. Youre worried that you wont be in with the in-crowd! I cant help it. I am what I am. So how might it work? If you were single, you would be powerfully aware that you are an odd number, so you would be thrashing around for another, indispensable single person to attach yourself to. Your whole life would turn into that painful, endgame phase in a game of musical chairs. If you were a couple without children, perhaps you might know four similar couples, who you are both equally fond of, and perhaps they might all like each other as much as you like them. And perhaps you might have tested these propositions by holidaying with one another in the past, which only deepened your mutual affections. Perhaps you are not real people at all; you are the brainchild of a junior scriptwriting collective, and you live in Netflixania, and one of you is neurotic and another is kooky, but that definitely doesnt annoy anybody. Add children and you are starting off as a unit of at least three; you probably only have room for one other household, maximum two. This looming decision-making reminds me of Brexit circa 2018, the effort of compromise driving everyone toward their least-preferred option. Its all about the maths. Or the physics, I cant remember which. I have a lot of buried referendum trauma. Theres no democratic way of doing this, says my Mr, authoritatively . What happens when we exhaust democracy in our house is known as Dictator for the Day. Its a parenting thing for siblings who cant get on. You stop trying to make them agree on a dinner menu, or the order in which they are to have a bath; you just make one of them dictator, on the understanding that one of the others will be dictator the next day. The kids just use it as cover to persecute one another (But thats what a dictator would do; The dictator is a metaphor; If you were being metaphorical, you should have said). But my Mr and I use it quite a lot between ourselves when we cant agree on a film. Obviously, because were adults, we can never remember who was dictator the last time round, so we always end up watching The Long Good Friday. But it wouldnt work in the bubble context, because it would be Dictator for an Unknown Number of Months. Is there even a point in forcing the decision? We could just wait to see who chooses us to be in their group. And it might be nobody, because we are quite wearing to be around, what with all the sporadic, metaphorical totalitarianism. I could see by my Mrs eyebrows that he was giving up on the bubble. You know what I like? he said. I like a Zoom. You hate a Zoom. Its a totally different experience of friendship. Nobody talks over each other  Nobody talks, everyone just asks questions. Its like being friends with a pub quiz machine. Ah, the quizzes. I love a Zoom quiz. Sincerely, you hate a Zoom quiz. Remember that time your brother photographed mainstream chocolate bars in cross section and we had to guess which ones they were? I do remember. One of them was a fish finger. You said it was immoral. Having to chat on a sub-optimal platform is hardly the cruellest adjustment of the age. But I dearly want to hug my friends  all of them, non-hierarchically and in no particular order, totally unpoliced and uninhibited  a limitless number of times. What you need, said my beloved, is 10 under-10s.","956"
"2020-05-01T14:28:23Z","books","Books","Publishers must act now to develop working-class writers, says report","The books industry needs to wake up to the world beyond the M25, according to a new report into the under-representation of British working-class writers, which lays out a damning indictment of the pervasive barriers in their way today. The report, Common People: Breaking the Glass Ceiling in UK Publishing, draws on evidence from the 17 working-class writers chosen for last years Common People anthology, along with industry experts. Published on Friday to mark International Workers Day, it says that the full range of voices in British society is neither heard nor acknowledged in UK publishing and that aspiring, working-class writers are at a disadvantage when trying to get a publishing deal. Barriers cited include a lack of support networks and contacts, lower levels of self-confidence and the publishing industrys lack of social diversity. Novelist Jessica Andrews, who wrote her 2019 debut Saltwater because she worried that the stories of working-class people were slipping away, said the most difficult part of writing for her was self-doubt. When I was writing my first novel, I learned to constantly push back against the fear that my experiences were trivial and uninteresting, or were not poetic or literary enough, and that is because I had rarely seen a life like mine represented in literary fiction, said Andrews, who won the Portico prize for the novel. An anonymous writer interviewed for the report highlighted the difference between their experience and that of a fellow author, who got his publishing deal through a friend of a friend, he got a newspaper column through a friend of a friend, he got on Radio 4 through a friend of a friend. When I spoke with him about his career development it was just like watching somebody on the ski slopes when youve never learned to ski, said the writer. Off they go with all their friends, whizz whizz whizz and youre still stood at the edge wondering how to strap on the ski boots. The reports author Katy Shaw, professor of contemporary writings at Northumbria University, writes that there has never been a more vital point at which working-class stories and voices needed to be heard in mainstream culture. After years of reports damning the publishing industry for its overwhelmingly middle-class and white workforce, publishers including Penguin Random House have launched schemes to find and publish writers from under-represented communities, while agencies like the Good Literary Agency, which is committed to representing writers from marginalised groups, have been successfully established. But the Common People project calls for even greater reform, with key recommendations including moving publishings focus away from London, through new public and private investment in launching more publishing ventures and writing development agencies outside the capital. More diversity among agents, editors and publishers was also stressed as key. We are past the time for listening and now we need some action, said novelist Kit de Waal, who edited the Common People anthology. De Waal used some of the advance from her first book to establish a writing scholarship for people from disadvantaged backgrounds at Birkbeck, University of London. The publishing industry  and the UK government  still needs to wake up to the world beyond the M25. It needs to diversify its workforce and do more than say were listening, De Waal writes in a foreword to the report. It is vital that the Common People project does not stand alone and become a piece of history. This research and its findings and recommendations need to be the beginning of something bigger and better, a living breathing thing that continues to change lives for creatives and the creative industries in the UK. Labour MP Jon Trickett welcomed the report as a counterweight to the over-representation of establishment voices in British cultural life. Every day I am continually delighted to encounter the unrecognised talent, wisdom, intelligence and creativity of working people. We all lose out, if we fail to hear their voices, said Trickett. The Common People project was launched by New Writing North and Writing West Midlands in 2018 and is the first ever joint research project between all seven UK regional writing development agencies.

David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capitals Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns.
Asked about the findings of the investigation, Singleton said he disclosed his business to superiors in the NHS, in accordance with the rules, and was told there was unlikely to be a conflict.
However, the NHS launched an immediate investigation. We take any potential conflicts of interest extremely seriously and as soon we became aware of these allegations an internal investigation was started, a spokesperson said.
A website for Singletons company, Sure Stock, which marketed PPE to private sector and NHS clients, made no reference to Singleton or his role in the health service. But in a phone call with an undercover reporter posing as a potential client, Singleton confirmed he was running the business. He said he was trading as a sales agent between suppliers and buyers of PPE.







According to Singletons LinkedIn profile, which he deleted shortly after the Guardian told him about its investigation, he is a head of procurement for the NHS in London. He works within a large commissioning support unit (CSU) that covers the capitals north and east and surrounding areas. It is understood the investigation is being conducted by his employer, the NHS north and east London CSU.
During the conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton said he was currently an NHS employee but said his role did not involve buying any products. I deliver services, he said. So none of the suppliers that Im working with do I have any interactions with during my day job.
Asked later whether he was exploiting his NHS expertise and contacts, Singleton said in a statement that he was not directly involved in responding to the PPE shortage in the NHS as my role does not involve purchasing or procuring of these products.
However, information collated by the Guardian, including internal NHS email evidence, suggests Singleton may have been involved in procuring PPE supplies. Asked to respond to a request for comment about the email evidence, Singleton replied no comment and hung up the phone. The NHS declined to comment on the email evidence.

Singleton created his PPE company on 15 April, as the shortage of protective equipment for NHS and other health and care workers working on the frontline of the coronavirus outbreak was reaching crisis point.
His company, Sure Stock Limited, originally registered to Singletons home in Essex, launched a website that same week, marketing PPE products for medical, dental, adult social care, the food industry and personal use.
The website offered large amounts of PPE and hygiene products for sale, including protective face shields, or smart visors, which were priced at 19,500 for minimum orders of 10,000 units.

Posing as an agent for a meat processing factory, a Guardian reporter approached Sure Stock claiming his client urgently needed large quantities of PPE to protect about 800 workers and return the facility to full production.
Sure Stocks salesperson, a friend and associate of Singleton, confirmed the company had been created by Singleton and said he could help source batches of 20,000 visors, masks, gowns and gloves  as well as 1,000 litres of hand sanitiser  as part of an initial order. The sale would have totalled more than 100,000.
The salesperson told the undercover reporter: Essentially a friend of mine is head of procurement for NHS London. He has really struggled to get stuff to people in the right timeframe. So essentially what we decided to do was set up a little company and become sales agents for people in the UK who have got stock. And then essentially we would help in linking up the supply chains that are massively disastrous at the moment.
The undercover reporter then asked to talk to Singleton directly. During a 40-minute telephone conversation, Singleton told the undercover reporter: What we do is we work with the supplier and then our margin, our commission, our referral, comes from them before the prices go out. So we just work as a sales agent.
He also disclosed he was an NHS employee. We want to nurture relationships like yours. Because people like you can open doors for some of my suppliers into areas that they dont currently reach into, he told the undercover reporter. So its growing a network of trusted suppliers and buyers because you cant be a supplier unless youve got a buyer. You cant be a buyer unless youve got a supplier. You need to have these things. You need to connect up.







Towards the end of the call, Singleton emphasised how competitive his visor prices were and encouraged the undercover reporter to piggyback a large order currently  going through with the Far East [and a UK importer]. He added: What Id close off by saying is when you are in a position where you know you want to place an order, rest assured that you are going to be dealing with a UK company.
Singleton told the undercover reporter that during the Covid-19 outbreak he had been redeployed to the Nightingale hospital at the Excel Centre and the Royal London hospital and was helping them set up their pop-up ITU [intensive treatment unit] wards and their stock rooms.
In his statement to the Guardian following the undercover investigation, Singleton said he had not set up ITUs or stock rooms and had not been involved in any procurement at the the hospital.
He said he had notified his employer about Sure Stock, as is required, and had been informed by a superior that there is unlikely to be a conflict, as it was perceived there would be no crossover in terms of customers. Singleton said declaring the directorship was the main step towards compliance and this had been completed.
However, the Guardian understands that while Singleton recently declared his new business via an internal online NHS reporting system, the disclosure was under review and had not yet been approved.
In his conversation with the undercover reporter, Singletons salesperson appeared to give conflicting accounts of whether or not the firm planned to market to the NHS. At one point he said: Were not really wanting to approach anyone in the NHS, because there is a bit of conflict of interest, so we are sort of staying out of that.
But during another part of the conversation, about the scarcity of gowns on the market, the salesperson said: Weve got a lot of NHS trusts frantically phoning around trying to get hold of these and they cant. He added: Now what we are doing with those, we are offering the NHS 30 days to pay.

The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for  and is responding to  the coronavirus pandemic. We want to learn more about recent decisions taken at the heart of government. If you're a whistleblower or source and with new information, you can email investigations@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message (UK) +44 7584 640566.

In his emailed statement, Singleton said Sure Stock has not and will not sell PPE and related equipment to the NHS, or any NHS organisation. He added: Any such allegation is false.
However, a photograph on Sure Stocks website advertising face shields showed a visor with the NHS logo printed on the front, and the company offered deals for NHS clients. For our NHS heroes your price is fixed! the website stated.
In his statement, Singleton said the face shields have not been sold to the NHS because they did not meet the complex medical devices regulations which govern the manufacture and supply of such products.
Sure Stocks website was mothballed shortly after Singleton was contacted by the Guardian for comment. It now just states: Coming soon.","1286"

Though these projects may have been organized under the objective of providing aid at a time of desperate need, their maudlin self-satisfaction could not stand up to scrutiny under the usual rubrics used to critique any other release. And so this was the specific strain of dread that Parks and Recreation fans brought to the news of a reunion episode hastily coordinated in order to put together donations for Feeding America, a nonprofit funding a vast network of pantries, soup kitchens and other community-based centers. A show that often lapsed into corniness in its later years seemed primed to return drenched in high-fructose corn syrup with an extra-hefty helping of creamed corn on the side.   Related: Amy Poehler: 'One must try to be a good citizen at this time'   Add to that the larger political incongruence of a distinctly Obama-era relic reviving itself in the festering dystopia of Trumpism, and the stage was set for a decently-intended minor debacle.

Things may have changed, faces have developed a few new lines, but the writing staff understands that ultimately its just nice to have the gang back together. They let the ensemble bounce off each other without letting external factors get in the way. Most significantly, the reunion episode sheds the political conscience that wedged the regular series into the zeitgeist during the previous presidential administration. A sunny can-do liberalism became Leslie Knope and cos calling card, an attitude that could not possibly be more out of joint in light of Americas slide into soft fascism and the utter failure of the Democratic party to halt it in any meaningful way. The notion of a cameo from Knope favorite Joe Biden, currently the subject of much discussion regarding accusations of sexual assault, was enough to turn any registered voters stomach. Mercifully, the show conceived as a comedy version of The West Wing now comes to us from a world without Bidens or Clintons or Trumps, its comedy unsullied by commentary at a time when we all just need a laugh.    And so the joke writers do what they do best, and get back to writing jokes. We start with a celebrity pop-in of the welcome variety, with Paul Rudd reprising pampered heir Bobby Newport at his familys private fox-hunting estate in Switzerland, where he hasnt caught any yet  theyre so fast, like zoop! And theyre gone! After warning of the dangers related to the coronus, he turns it over to our pals from Pawnee, who are of course all taking the proper precautions. Their individual check-ins form the logical extension of those what would X-sitcoms characters be doing under quarantine? articles, giving each character a moment fitting what we know about them to our new status quo. Adam Scotts Ben Wyatt has combined his two great passions by writing a script for a Cones of Dunshire claymation movie, as punishingly dense as the board game inspiring it. Hes isolating separately from wife Leslie, who makes the most pointed comment while mentioning that it was sad, but necessary that she had to shut down every national park. Shes done her part by starting a bunch of committees and organizing a phone tree, which gives structure to this series of video calls conducted under the in-universe platform of Gryzzl. Once viewers get acclimated to the disjointed comic pacing that results from no two actors sharing the same space, its harmless fun. Its like visiting your hometown to find everything right where you left it, a bit sweet and a bit sad. Nick Offermans Ron Swanson still loves meat, and gets one of the biggest laughs by reminding us of the hysterical matrimonial dynamic at play in the Offerman-Mullally household. As wannabe baller Tom Haverford, Aziz Ansari still fixates on seeming with it, name-checking Fortnite and using background filters to place himself in a faux Bali. Dedicated nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) is on the frontlines, and must quarantine in a different part of the house from her husband, Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), as he donates blood four times each day. Rettas ever-elegant Donna Meagle situates herself in front of a wall of chromatically arranged sneakers. Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt, their careers having risen most precipitously in the years since the finale, get the least to do. We learn that the Luddgate-Dwyer household has a drum set, but most importantly, Pratt leads the stirring sing-along of Bye Bye, Lil Sebastian that takes us out. Its an easy way to conclude with something momentous and cathartic, and yet far from the worst-case scenario as to how this couldve all gone.    The episode succeeds by allowing itself to be little more than a half-hour of humor. Its never better than when crafting great setups and punchlines for the tertiary faces making quick appearances. (Boozy newswoman Joan Calamezzo has an EGOT because she has been kicked out of all four major awards ceremonies; cologne magnate Dennis Feinstein markets a scent called Miracle Cure; fan-beloved Jean-Ralphio claims to have been banned from Cameo for recording his videos naked.)  By that same tack, the weakest moment comes when the episode adopts an about-face for the lines: Things will go back to normal. They just have to. Most Americans have made their peace with the fact that things will most definitely not snap back to normal when this all ends, and that by no means do they have to. In a lesser world, the episode would have been ripe with hollow feel-good platitudes like that one, but someone knew better. As Preston Sturges teaches us by the conclusion of Sullivans Travels, people living in times of hardship dont need to be preached to. We just need a break from all the damned stress, and Pawnees finest happily obliged.","1048"
"2020-05-01T14:13:21Z","world","World news","Where did Covid-19 come from? What we know about its origins","Why are the origins of the pandemic so controversial? How Covid-19 began has become increasingly contentious, with the US and other allies suggesting China has not been transparent about the origins of the outbreak. Donald Trump, the US president, has given credence to the idea that intelligence exists suggesting the virus may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although the US intelligence community has pointedly declined to back this up. The scientific community says there is no current evidence for this claim. This follows reports that the White House had been pressuring US intelligence community on the claim, recalling the Bush administrations pressure to stove pipe the intelligence before the war in Iraq. Whats the problem with the Chinese version? A specific issue is that the official origin story doesnt add up in terms of the initial epidemiology of the outbreak, not least the incidence of early cases with no apparent connection to the Wuhan seafood market, where Beijing says the outbreak began. If these people were not infected at the market, or via contacts who were infected at the market, critics ask, how do you explain these cases? The Wuhan labs Two laboratories in Wuhan studying bat coronaviruses have come under the spotlight. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is a biosecurity level 4 facility  the highest for biocontainment  and the level 2 Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, which is located not far from the fish market, had collected bat coronavirus specimens. Several theories have been promoted. The first, and wildest, is that scientists at WIV were engaged in experiments with bat coronavirus, involving so-called gene splicing, and the virus then escaped and infected humans. A second version is that sloppy biosecurity among lab staff and in procedures, perhaps in the collection or disposal of animal specimens, released a wild virus. Is there any evidence the virus was engineered? The scientific consensus rejecting the virus being engineered is almost unanimous. In a letter to Nature in March, a team in California led by microbiology professor Kristian Andersen said the genetic data irrefutably shows that [Covid-19] is not derived from any previously used virus backbone  in other words spliced sections of another known virus. Far more likely, they suggested, was that the virus emerged naturally and became stronger through natural selection. We propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of Sars-CoV-2: natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic [animal to human] transfer; and natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. Peter Ben Embarek, an expert at the World Health Organization in animal to human transmission of diseases, and other specialists also explained to the Guardian that if there had been any manipulation of the virus you would expect to see evidence in both the gene sequences and also distortion in the data of the family tree of mutations  a so-called reticulation effect. In a statement to the Guardian, James Le Duc, the head of the Galveston National Laboratory in the US, the biggest active biocontainment facility on a US academic campus, also poured cold water on the suggestion. There is convincing evidence that the new virus was not the result of intentional genetic engineering and that it almost certainly originated from nature, given its high similarity to other known bat-associated coronaviruses, he said. What about an accidental escape of a wild sample because of poor lab safety practices? The accidental release of a wild sample has been the focus of most attention, although the evidence offered is at best highly circumstantial. The Washington Post has reported concerns in 2018 over security and management weakness from US embassy officials who visited the WIV several times, although the paper also conceded there was no conclusive proof the lab was the source of the outbreak. Le Duc, however, paints a different picture of the WIV. I have visited and toured the new BSL4 laboratory in Wuhan, prior to it starting operations in 2017-  It is of comparable quality and safety measures as any currently in operation in the US or Europe. He also described encounters with Shi Zhengli, the Chinese virologist at the WIV who has led research into bat coronaviruses, and discovered the link between bats and the Sars virus that caused disease worldwide in 2003, describing her as fully engaged, very open and transparent about her work, and eager to collaborate. Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist who worked with Shi as part of a US-funded viral research programme, echoed Le Ducs assessment. She said she believed the lab escape theory was an absolute conspiracy theory and referred to Shi as brilliant. Problems with the timeline and map of the spread of the virus While the experts who spoke to the Guardian made clear that understanding of the origins of the virus remained provisional, they added that the current state of knowledge of the initial spread also created problems for the lab escape theory. When Peter Forster, a geneticist at Cambridge, compared sequences of the virus genome collected early in the Chines outbreak  and later globally  he identified three dominant strains. Early in the outbreak, two strains appear to have been in circulation at roughly at the same time  strain A and strain B  with a C variant later developing from strain B. But in a surprise finding, the version with the closest genetic similarity to bat coronavirus was not the one most prevalent early on in the central Chinese city of Wuhan but instead associated with a scattering of early cases in the southern Guangdong province. Between 24 December 2019 and 17 January 2020, Forster explains, just three out of 23 cases in Wuhan were type A, while the rest were type B. In patients in Guangdong province, however, five out of nine were found to have type A of the virus. The very small numbers notwithstanding, said Forster, the early genome frequencies until 17 January do not favour Wuhan as an origin over other parts of China, for example five of nine Guangdong/Shenzhen patients who had A types. In other words, it still remains far from certain that Wuhan was even necessarily where the virus first emerged. If there is no evidence of engineering and the origin is still so disputed, why are we still talking about the Wuhan labs theory? The pandemic has exacerbated existing geopolitical struggles, prompting a disinformation war that has drawn in the US, China, Russia and others. Journalists and scientists have been targeted by people with an apparent interest in pushing circumstantial evidence related to the viruss origins, perhaps as part of this campaign and to distract from the fact that few governments have had a fault-free response. What does this mean now? The current state of knowledge about coronavirus and its origin suggest the most likely explanation remains the most prosaic. Like other coronaviruses before, it simply spread to humans via a natural event, the starting point for many in the scientific community including the World Health Organization. Further testing in China in the months ahead may eventually establish the source of the outbreak. But for now it is too early.","1181"

The airline industry today illustrated that there could be much more pain ahead. Irish budget airline Ryanair said it would cut 3,000 jobs, Aer Lingus is reportedly considering cutting 900 jobs, while Heathrow Airport warned that mass redundancies could also be on the cards. Here are some of the other major developments from today:  US stock markets fell after Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China in retaliation for its role in the coronavirus crisis, citing an unproven theory on its origin. Royal Bank of Scotland took an 800m profit hit because of the pandemics economic effects - and it also ended a short-lived experiment to create an app-based bank to rival the likes of Monzo.  British households repaid 3.8bn of consumer credit, including 2.4bn on credit cards and 1.4bn on car finance and other personal loans, during March - the largest since records began in 1987 and a sign of the massive drop in consumption prompted by the pandemic.  ExxonMobil, the US supermajor oil producer, took a $3bn charge in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak pushed it to a $610m loss - its first loss in three decades.

JJ     3.05pm BST  US manufacturing PMI slumps to weakest since April 2009  The woes of the US manufacturing sector were laid bare by a PMI reading that was the worst since 2009, as employment prospects in the sector were decimated.  The April purchasing managers index (PMI) reading was 41.5, down 7.6 points from the March reading of 49.1, according to the US Institute of Supply Management. Economists had expected a reading of 35, far below the 50 mark that denotes expanding output in the sector. IHS Markits separate US manufacturing PMI hit 36.1 in April, down from 48.5 in March and the previously released flash figure of 36.9. That was the lowest for just over eleven years as well. Binay Chandgothia, portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors, said:  A 12.4-point drop in the U.S. PMI is an absolute outlier for a single month. Even during the global financial crisis, it dropped by a max of 5.9 points from September 2008 (44.8) to October 2008 (38.9). However, weve seen similar data across global markets over the last few weeks, so there is little shock value in todays numbers. The markets have already moved beyond analysing the anticipated immediate collapse in economic activity to focusing on the duration of it. While there are some initial signs of stabilisation in indicators that have already dropped precipitously, the markets would like to see continued progress  moving from a stabilisation phase to a recovery phase.   Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said:  April saw the manufacturing sector struck hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with output falling to an extent surpassing that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis. With orders collapsing at a rate not seen for over a decade, supply chains disrupted to a record degree and pessimism about the outlook hitting a new survey high, rising numbers of firms are culling payroll numbers.       2.45pm BST   One for the committed central bank watchers among our readers: Tiff Macklem is the new governor of the Bank of Canada (Mark Carneys alma mater).

Photograph: Niall Carson/PA   Aer Lingus, British Airways stablemate, has reportedly told unions it is seeking staff cuts of around 20% due to the coronavirus pandemic. Cuts of that scale at the Irish flagcarrier would be roughly in line with British Airways, which plans to make 12,000 redudancies, about a quarter of its workers. Reuters reported the plans, citing a source close to the talks.  It said:  Aer Lingus, part of International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns British Airways, declined to comment, saying it was continuing to communicate directly with our employees and engage with their representative bodies. Cuts of 20% would represent around 800-900 staff, with management promising to offer a voluntary redundancy programme, the source said.  International Airlines Group, BA and Aer Linguss owner, has gained state aid for its Spanish airlines, Iberia and Vueling.     1.50pm BST   The crisis has proved to be something of a reckoning for the oil industry, and ExxonMobil in particular. The company is facing increasing investor pressure to act on the climate crisis, with the Church of Englands investment fund targeting Exxons board over their lack of movement to tackle the biggest issue of the time. At the same time, ExxonMobil pretty much missed the shale boom in its own back yard, and debt-fuelled expansion has left it vulnerable. In a symbol of the times, Netflix, last month overtook Exxon by market capitalisation. And that was all before oil prices plunged. One barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the North American benchmark, will set you back less than $20 (even after rising by 6% today).

Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters   It is a sign of the strange times that investors around the world are closely following the progress of drug development. The ups and downs of the testing process for remdesivir have caused billions of pounds of money to shift around the world as people hope for an effective antiviral treatment. Shares in the drugs maker, Gilead, have risen by 29% this year thanks to hopes the drug (previously developed to fight Ebola) will prove effective at fighting Covid-19. On Friday its chief executive said he expected the US Food and Drug Administration to act quickly over the companys application for approval. Gilead would try to get the drug to as many people as possible if it was approved, he said. Were moving very quickly with the FDA, Daniel ODay said in an interview with NBCs Today show, via Reuters. And I expect that theyre going to act very quickly.     12.30pm BST   Sterling has slipped to a one-week low against the euro, with analysts blaming Brexit back-and-forth and a general aversion to riskier assets (as evidenced by the stock market selloff). And remember, with many investors in Europe on holiday (even if confined to their homes) it is likely that trading is thinner than normal. The pound lost 0.7% to hit a low of 1.1408. Against the dollar sterling lost 0.5% to hit lows of $1.2525, after gaining strongly yesterday. Reuters summary of the latest Brexit shenanigans said:  A source close to Britains negotiating team said the country was confident it can get a deal on future ties with the European Union if Brussels started treating it as an independent negotiator. But, underlining what sources in Brussels say is an impasse at talks since Britain left the EU in January, French officials later reiterated the 27-nation blocs position that London must make concessions for a deal to be reached this year. The two sides have been unable to find any compromise on three main areas - the so-called level playing field guarantees of fair competition, governance and fisheries policy, according to the sources in Brussels and London.  Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, a trading platform, said the pound was hit because it is seen as less of a safe haven given the added political risk. He said:   The main driver for sterlings weakness is the change in market sentiment to a more sombre mood, and this wont support currencies that are more closely linked to risk.       12.13pm BST      A cleaner at work in an empty Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport on 15 April. Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images   Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrance to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission.  Passenger numbers at the UKs largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures.  Full report here:   Related: Heathrow boss warns of BA-style mass redundancies       11.43am BST   An interesting side note to Royal Bank of Scotlands results this morning: as well as a big impairment for bad debts related to the crisis, it is closing its effort to create a digital-first lender to rival the likes of Monzo, Revolut and Starling. That project, named (fairly inexplicably) as B, appears to have failed - although RBS said it was just deciding to roll the technology and the brand under its Mettle brand for lending to small businesses.  Also worth noting that RBS is winding down B, its short-lived and questionable attempt to take on digital rivals like Monzo that launched in November.

Unite will argue that the decision should be reversed. Referring also to British Airways decision to cut 12,000 jobs, Unite national officer for aviation Oliver Richardson said:  This is another premature announcement, especially while the governments job retention scheme remains fully up and running. Ryanair has significant cash reserves and is in a better place than many airlines to cope with the challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic has created.  The union also called for the government to intervene with aid for the sector, despite concerns over its environmental impact.     11.11am BST   Most of Europe may be on holiday today, but for investors in the UK and US May day is not looking very relaxing. The FTSE 100 has lost 2.1% so far, to 5,775 points. The FTSE 250 is down by 1.7%. Markets in the US open in just over three hours, and stock market futures are pointing to heavy declines. The Nasdaq is set to fall 2.5%, the Dow Jones industrial average is expected to lose 1.9% and the S&P 500, the most important benchmark, is set to lose 2%.     11.03am BST   An interesting story on the insurance industry this morning: the Financial Conduct Authority wants the courts to clarify whether businesses can claim money for business interruption caused by the coronavirus. The Cit watchdog also told all insurers to assess whether they should be giving partial policy refunds during the pandemic. A lot of companies have been distraught to hear that their insurance will not pay out because pandemics are not covered by their terms. Fine print like that has helped the insurance industry to weather the first storm (although recession will likely weigh on their profits eventually). Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive of the FCA, said:  We have been clear that we believe in the majority of cases, business interruption insurance was not purchased to, and is unlikely to, cover the current emergency. However, there remain a number of policies where it is clear that the firm has an obligation to pay out on a policy.  In addition to this court action, the current emergency has altered the value of some insurance products and we believe that insurers should be looking at both whether their products still offer value.  Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said:  This is a welcome step from the FCA and insurers will look to work closely with the regulator to make this process a success. Although the vast majority of business interruption policies do not cover pandemics and the Government has confirmed it will not seek to retrospectively amend contracts, we support any process that will provide clarity and certainty for the minority of customers who are disputing whether they should be covered.      10.51am BST   Battening down the hatches is the metaphor of choice to describe the Bank of Englands lending data, as the coronavirus storm hit. The data dont contain any of the governments emergency loan schemes, so expect much more in April. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said:    April data will be more illuminating, as they will reflect the impact of the furlough scheme and rising unemployment on households incomes and cash holdings. But with all households seemingly running a very tight ship at present, excess savings should accumulate this year, potentially laying the ground for a strong rebound in spending in 2021, when the virus should no longer be a threat.       10.46am BST   Back on those extraordinary Bank of England data, households paid back 2.4bn of credit card debt - suggesting a huge fall in consumption that almost certainly augurs a recession.  There was 5.4bn less lending to households than February - and that was with only a week of full lockdown. Aprils data will certainly be interesting... Businesses work differently to households: they took on new loans at record rates as they tried to secure liquidity, while also piling up as much cash as possible in their bank accoutns.  Overall sterling money holdings and borrowing - basically what cash companies and households have easily to hand - both rose to their all-time series highs, of 57.4bn and 55.3bn respectively.

As it grapples with a collapse in rental income, the owner of the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex has agreed waivers with some of its lenders, particularly the seven banks which provide its overdraft facility, to prevent potential breaches. It had warned in late March that it would breach the terms on its debt commitments following a collapse in rent.   Updated at 10.27am BST    10.08am BST   The final reading of IHS Markits manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) confirms what we already knew: it is a dire situation for British factories. The UKs manufacturing PMI reading came in at 32.6 in April, slightly worse than the flash reading of 32.9. Thats confirmed as a record low. A reading of 50 is expansion, so 32.6 is... very low.     Manufacturing output fell to its lowest on record in April, according to IHS Markit. Photograph: IHS Markit    There were survey-record contractions in output, new orders, employment and new export business. Lead times for products were also at record levels as supply chain disruptions hit. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit,said:  UK manufacturing suffered its worst month in recent history in April, as output, orders books and employment all fell at rates far surpassing anything seen in the PMI surveys 28-year history. Huge swathes of industry were hit hard by company closures, weak global demand, lockdowns and social distancing measures in response to COVID-19. The only pockets of growth were seen at firms making medical and food products.   Updated at 10.09am BST    9.56am BST  Credit card lending falls for first time on record - Bank of England  UK consumers credit card debt fell in annual terms for the first time since the Bank of England started tracking the data in 1987 in March, as lockdown froze spending but job guarantees kept millions in work. The annual growth rate of credit card lending fell to -0.3%, the first negative annual growth since the series began. British households repaid 3.8bn of consumer credit, which also includes personal loans, during the month - the largest on record.    The consumer debt repayment was the largest since Bank of England records began in 1987. Photograph: Bank of England       9.43am BST  UK consumer credit growth and mortgage approvals both lowest since 2013  The amount of credit offered to UK consumers grew at the slowest pace since 2013 in March, while the number of mortgage approvals fell to its lowest in the same period, according to the Bank of England. Mortgage approvals for house purchase fell to 56,200, their lowest level since March 2013.  The weak net flows of consumer credit meant that the annual growth rate fell to 3.7% in March, lowest since June 2013.      9.29am BST   Some interesting moves on currency markets after Donald Trump last night suggested that he might try to hit China with more tariffs in retaliation for its role in the crisis. The US president said last night that a trade deal with China was now of secondary importance to the coronavirus pandemic. He also threatened new tariffs on Beijing and said he had seen evidence for the unproven theory that Sars-CoV-2 originated in a Wuhan infectious disease lab. The prospect of another bout of economic warfare has weighed on the Chinese yuan traded in Hong Kong.

John Holland-Kaye, according to Reuters, has said the government maybe doesnt understand how important aviation is for the rest of the economy. Virgin Atlantic (a major presence at Heathrow) may go bust without help, he said. It is disappointing that the UK stands out from other countries in not offering state aid to its airline industry, he said. That echoes the criticisms of Ryanairs chief executive. However, the UK government has been wary of bailing out airlines and their wealthy shareholders - particularly the billionaire-controlled Virgin Atlantic. There has also been sustained pressure for the government not to help some of the economys biggest polluters without conditions that they cut emissions. Heathrows comments came as it reported that passenger numbers declined by 18.3% during the first three months of 2020 to 14.6m and are expected to bedown by around 97% in April.   Spending has been reduced by 650m. The airport could sustain itself for 12 months even with no passengers, it said.     9.02am BST   In the barrage of corporate news earlier, we didnt cover Nationwides house price index, which showed that the housing market was actually heating up before the crisis.  Annual house price growth increased to 3.7% in April, up from 3% in March-the fastest pace since February 2017 (when annual growth was 4.5%). That was the seventh month of growth in a row. The average price was 222,915.  But with something of a caveat: it didnt take into account the biggest health and economic crisis of our lifetime. Before the lockdown unemployment and borrowing costs were low, while the general election had given buyers some short-lived certainty. Robert Gardner, Nationwides chief economist, said:   Its important to note that the impact of the pandemic is not fully captured in this months figures. This is becauseour index is constructed using mortgage approval data, and there is a lag between mortgage applications being submitted and approved. Indeed, circa 80% of cases in the April sample relate to mortgage applications that commenced prior to the lock-down, and hence before the full extent of the impact of the pandemic became clear.  Here are the graphs. Note the recent pick-up:    House prices accelerated before the lockdown, according to Nationwide.

There will be final announcement by 1 July, he said:  Some of the other regional bases will be very marginal this winter.  The return to normal tourism volumes could take as long as three years, OLeary said.     8.39am BST   Ryanairs OLeary has also hammered home his point about state aid, saying that his airline and others that dont have government support face a torrid couple of years. He said:  When we have to come back well have to compete with airlines that have limitless state aid funds to enable them to engage in below-cost selling.    Its going to be a torrid couple of years for airlines like Ryanair, BA, and others who dont get state aid. Its going to be a great couple of years for passengers: you will see lower air fares, you will see, certainly this summer, lower hotel prices in place like Spain, Portugal and Italy as they try to recover something of their tourism season.      8.34am BST  Ryanair boss: More job cuts may be necessary     Ryanair CEO Michael OLeary said he was unsure on further job cuts. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images   Ryanair chief executive Michael OLeary has raised the prospect of further job cuts down the line if the a coronavirus vaccine is not found quickly. The airlines has cut 15% of its staff, and OLeary said that is the minumum we need to survive the next 12 months. Speaking on BBC TV, he added:   If a vaccine is found, then clearly the recovery will be stronger. If a vaccine isnt found then clearly we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts into the future.   The airline will carry fewer than 140,000 passengers in April, May and June, against pre-crisis forecasts of 42m. For the year passenger numbers will be less than 100m versus the 155m forecast. OLeary said:  While we expect to be back flying some services in July and August we think that the build-up will be slow. Passengers will be wearing face masks, there will be temperature checks at airports.   Updated at 8.35am BST    8.15am BST   Ryanairs job cuts will start in July, subject to consultations with unions. The airline said:   As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, until summer 2022 at the earliest.  The job cuts will hit pilot and cabin crew jobs mainly. There will also be unpaid leave, and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office, Ryanair said. Group chief executive Michael OLeary has extended a 50% pay cut from May until the end of March 2021. Our early report is available here:   Related: Ryanair to cut 3,000 jobs as coronavirus grounds flights       8.14am BST  BA's sister airlines receive 1bn in state aid  While British Airways has just moved to lay off 12,000 staff, telling them that there was no government help available, its sister airlines in parent company IAG in Spain have just been granted 1bn in state-backed loans. Iberia has signed a financing agreement for 750m and Vueling for 260m for bank loans guaranteed by the Spanish Instituto de Crdito Oficial, under a Covid-19 scheme set up by Spain to help business. The loans have restrictions to stop the cash being shared with BA or others at IAG. The news came as Ryanair hit out at state aid being given to rival European carriers, with Lufthansa, Air France and KLM expected to share the bulk of around 30bn in bailouts.

The majority state-owned bank announced on Friday that pre-tax profits had fallen to 519m in the first three months of the 2020, compared to just over 1bn a year earlier. It was hurt by the 802m charge, which was driven by forecasts for potential loan losses due to an economic downturn that could make it harder for it retail and business customers to repay their debts. The bank, soon to be renamed NatWest, said:  [The group] has significant exposures to many of the commercial sectors that are already being impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, including property, retail, leisure, travel and shipping.  It brings the total loan loss charges announced by the five largest UK banks to around 7.4bn for the first quarter.     7.46am BST  Ryanair to cut 3,000 jobs amid coronavirus crisis     Three people walk on the runway amongst parked and temporarily out of service Ryanair passenger aircraft at Stansted Airport.

Its May Day, and those stock markets that are not on holiday have started the month with a nasty fall, taking their lead from disappointments last night on Wall Street. Wall Street recorded its best month since 1987 in April - thanks to the timing of the rebound from the market bottom in March - and easing lockdowns is the talk of major economies.

I was 28 and casting my debut film, The Warrior, about a conflicted enforcer in feudal India. None of the actors Id seen were right. Id tell them I wanted to make a western, a mix of Robert Bresson and Sergio Leone, and their eyes would glaze. They werent interested in doing a movie without songs or romance or much dialogue, filmed far away in Rajasthan and the Himalayas. A film which wasnt typically British and was shot in Hindi, but wasnt totally Indian, either.    Neither British nor Indian  The Warrior. Photograph: Ronald Grant     Related: Film of the week: The Warrior   Irrfan walked in the room and in that moment I knew he was right. He had this incredible presence and beautiful face and unusual puffy eyes. He loved world cinema, got the tone and references and liked the challenge of telling a story without words. Afterwards I said to my friend Amit, with whom I was casting: He looks like someone whos killed a lot of people, but feels really bad about it. The only problem was that he seemed such a wonderful, warm guy we had to toughen him up a bit. That was part of the fun. He was 34 then and got better-looking and more in shape as he aged. We went to the desert and the mountains for the shoot and he saw snow for the first time. It was very low-budget and pre-digital, so there was no playback or wriggle-room. You just watched him do a take, then went: That was amazing! OK  moving on!    Before that, Irrfan had been thinking about quitting acting because he was getting bored. He hadnt been offered a role that allowed him to demonstrate his great gift, which was to say so much with just a glance. He elevated simple lines to brilliant cinematic moments, could make you feel something very complex and emotional by doing very little. He was a real movie star. Over the years, The Warrior cast and crew stayed in touch and had reunions, which is quite unusual in this business. There was a real connection, and Irrfan  soulful, tall, elegant, slightly otherworldly  was our spiritual leader. Even before he was famous, he had immense dignity and charisma. Some actors can be quite ordinary when theyre not done up. He didnt have to be in costume. Even when people didnt know who he was  in a shop, or walking down the street  they would stop and stare. Once we were on a flight together, in economy, and every five minutes stewardesses came up to ask if he needed anything.     Irrfan Khan and Asif Kapadia celebrate winning the London film festivals Sutherland award for best feature in 2001. Photograph: Asif Kapadia   The Warrior won Baftas and the Sutherland award for best first film at the London film festival; the next day we went to my mums house in Hackney for lunch. Miramax bought the US rights but Harvey Weinstein put the film on a shelf for years which killed it. And it was disqualified from the foreign-language category of the Oscars  that upset Irrfan, too; he wasnt without ambition. But we both got noticed and he went on to make movies with Danny Boyle, Michael Winterbottom, Wes Anderson and Ang Lee. I worked with David Fincher recently and asked him how hed come across me. He said: Oh, my best friend came over with a DVD and told me I had to watch it. That turned out to be Brad Pitt, and the DVD was Senna. I think Pitt had been told to watch it by Irrfan, when they worked together on A Mighty Heart.  No matter what the movie, I always felt Irrfan was the best and most believable thing in it, because he was so honest  everything he did had soul and truth. As his career took off, he remained the same. Hed always been outward-looking and international, which is why he could so seamlessly work across so many genres and countries. Fame never changed him. Wed try to meet up whenever I was in India or he in London. Wed talk movies and go to the British Museum and Primrose Hill and our kids would play football together. When he was having treatment here Id visit him in hospital and wed head to the local park or cafe, or hed come to our home. He talked about his illness in a way Ive never before heard anyone discuss cancer. He was extremely inquisitive and wanted to understand exactly what was going on.    Outward-looking  on the Warrior set in India. Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/FilmFour   In 2018, I invited Irrfan and his eldest son to an early cut of my Diego Maradona documentary. Why did you make this film? he asked in the edit suite a few days later. What does this film say about you? His notes were really tough! He wanted me to make the film more personal; as much about me as about Maradona. They were good notes. Irrfan knew me well enough to say he didnt like that cut - but he didnt want to tell me in front of 50 people. He returned to India and wed message from time to time. Sometimes hed reply and sometimes his wife, Sutapa. Its difficult when a friend lives on the other side of the world. The other week I found some pictures from that first casting session in the dodgy hotel from 1999 and I sent them to him. Sutapa wrote back saying: Oh, hes wearing his lucky black shirt.   Related: Irrfan Khan  a life in pictures   In the spring Irrfan sent me a photo of his new calf. He was always telling me to come and visit his farm outside Mumbai; I never got there. You always think theres time and then you run out of it. He and I were so in sync for a while, partly I think because the film we made was slightly out of step with the rest of the world. It didnt neatly fit in, and neither did we. Its like losing a brother. He used to ring me up at 2am and Id be worried something bad had happened. Oh no, hed say, I just missed you and wanted to chat.

As a generally apocalyptically minded sort of person, Ive been feeling some pride in watching my favourite question become everyone elses favourite question, too; its like being a 19th-century aristocrat and seeing your debutante daughter become the star of the London season. But in deciding who to listen to, and thus how alarmed to be, its easy to overlook a crucial factor: in a crisis as all-consuming as this one, nobody  not academic experts, not media commentators, not that one friend who keeps urging you to be less (or more) worried than you are  is a completely neutral observer. Because predictions about the future arent solely about the future. Theyre also coping mechanisms for dealing with the present. This is obvious enough in the case of the strenuous optimist who insists that in a few weeks everything will be back to normal; shes clearly attempting to generate a sense of security in a time of uncertainty. But its been fascinating to witness the opposite, too: the people in my social circle, and especially my social media feeds, who seem deeply invested in asserting that things will be worse than the rest of us can imagine. (Even professional epidemiologists are engaged in an arms race to predict a longer and longer timeframe for social distancing.) Psychologically, though, this makes sense. When everythings up in the air, the person foreseeing absolute disaster has found solid ground: at least things wont get worse than that. Likewise, consider our political reactions to the pandemic. Fury at the governments response may be highly justified, but if being angry at the Tories has always been central to your personality, to be angry at the Tories now is also a perverse source of comfort. Virtually nothing may be the same, these days  but at least the Tories remain hateable. The point here isnt to dismiss any particular outlook on the grounds that its partly a coping mechanism. (Nobody gets by without some coping mechanisms. Mine include writing columns about other peoples.) But its useful to see the role they play, if only to stop yourself spiralling into anxiety next time someone you trust paints an especially dark picture of the future. They may be proven right, of course. But whats certain is theyre a human, engaging in their own private methods for managing their emotions.   Related: If somethings out of your control, should you still worry about it? | Oliver Burkeman   Besides, its worth remembering that this calamity is further evidence for the truth that most of us, most of the time, have no idea whats coming. On your pessimistic days you should remember, three months ago you would have dismissed the idea of the world being locked down with a pandemic, the economist Kaushik Basu observed recently. Extrapolating from your poor record of forecasting, you should realise your current forecast of future gloom may also be completely wrong. I dont think thats an argument for replacing pessimism with optimism, but for trying to suspend both. Theres a lightness that comes with giving up, if only a little, the demand to know what tomorrow holds. They say that if you expect the worst, youll only be pleasantly surprised, but that way you still have to feel glum now. The real skill  while doing your best to prepare for the future  is to avoid expecting anything.

"2020-05-01T14:00:02Z","lifeandstyle","Life and style","My boyfriend has sexual kinks I find abhorrent. How can we resolve our differences?","My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. We enjoy a very active sex life. However, some of the things he is sexually attracted to are just abhorrent to me. He enjoys being dominated and treated as if he were a woman, with clothes and makeup, and wants me to act as if I were a man, including changing my vocal pitch and calling him derogatory names. I tell him it makes me highly uncomfortable, and he tries to respect that, but sometimes, in the heat of the moment, hell ask and I feel pressured to say yes, so as not to ruin the mood. I dont want to hurt his feelings but it seems the only way he listens is if I tell him my thoughts on it in a very assertive way. His argument is that if I did it more often, then I would start to like it because thats how he got interested in the things I like. The difference is that he didnt have any previous experience with my kinks, whereas I already had an established dislike for his. I love him with all my heart, and in every other aspect of our relationship Im 100% satisfied, but we are having trouble resolving this. No matter how adventurous or conventional ones sex life is, if both partners dont agree with doing something, then it stops being fun and tips into something else. If you feel pressured into doing something sexual, is it still consensual? I contacted sex and relationship psychotherapist Silva Neves (cosrt.org.uk). His first thought was that there wasnt a lot of hope of you getting to like this kink because youre using words such as abhorrent; you have an established dislike of his kink and when you start with that, its really hard to change and meet halfway. For your boyfriend it was different; when he was introduced to your kink, he was neutral towards it, tried it and was able to incorporate it into his sex life. Because of that, he expects you to be able to do the same; but not all kinks are equal. Of course, in various aspects of relationships, we sometimes have to try new things, and compromise, but if he is asking you to do something that is really not acceptable to you, Neves said, This goes into a question of sexual health principles, and one of them is consent. In other words, you have to want to do it, not just do it to please him. If you dont, over time, you will not only start to resent each other but if you dont feel relaxed during sex, it may well kill your sex drive, because youll be constantly worrying youll be asked to do something you dont want to. You say that this is a no-go for you, but in other ways you are very happy, so what to do? A lot of couples have different erotic worlds that dont match, Neves said, but you can still have a successful relationship. He suggested shifting your focus from How can I enjoy this kink? to accepting that its really OK to not like something and not try to force yourself. What you need is an honest conversation  dont wait until you are having sex. Honesty is more important than sugar-coating it, Neves advised. If you try to do that, he may think youre leaving the door ajar and if he just pushes it a bit more, you may give in. Over time this will erode the relationship. Instead, Neves suggested talking to him with love, kindness and empathy. You can talk about all the other things you can do together but make it very clear that this one thing is not for you.   Related: Should we tell my grandson his father is a drug addict?   Also make it clear that you arent asking him to repress his kink, just that you dont want to do it with him. So you may decide, Neves said, that he explores that kink with other people and you open up the relationship to include that, or that he masturbates thinking about it on his own, or finds some erotica to fantasise over, so that he doesnt have to repress it. He has to find ways of expressing his fantasy, because that side of his sexuality sounds really important to him, so he shouldnt feel ashamed about it. But you have to think about the boundaries of your relationship. Its important to think about how he can give vent to his kink without involving you, because to deny it would erode his sense of self over time. Neither of you is right or wrong, but you have very different needs and they must both be recognised and respected. If you can manage this, it bodes well for future stumbling blocks in your relationship.  Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a family-related problem sent in by a reader.

More than 127,000 people have liked a photo of chalked-up tree names in a London suburb, while a video of botanist Boris Presseq of Toulouse Museum of Natural History chalking up names to highlight street flowers in the French city has had 7m views.

Presseq told the Guardian: I wanted to raise awareness of the presence, knowledge and respect of these wild plants on sidewalks. People who had never taken the time to observe these plants now tell me their view has changed. Schools have contacted me since to work with students on nature in the city.
France banned pesticide use in parks, streets and other public spaces in 2017 and in gardens from 2019, leading to a surge in awareness of urban wild flowers in the country.
French botanist and campaigner Sophie Leguil, who lives in London, set up the More Than Weeds campaign to change perceptions of urban plants in the UK after helping to spread the Sauvages de ma rue (wild things of my street) chalking campaign in France led by Tela Botanica. She has won permission to chalk up Hackneys highways and make chalk trails to highlight the forgotten flora at our feet and is asking other councils to allow the same.





This week, the Guardian's Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.
Around 55% of the worlds population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Natures role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.
The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.
In this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.





The pesticide ban in France has played a major role as it has forced local authorities and mentalities to change, and raised awareness, said Leguil.
Ive been wanting to do it on a larger scale, with permission, and I hope to get more authorities interested in creating trails. We talk a lot about plant blindness  what if putting names on plants could make people look at them in a different way? I despair at how sanitised London has become. Plants can be managed differently, with benefits  cost-saving, biodiversity, education.

In the UK it is illegal to chalk anything  hopscotch, art or botanical names  on paths or highways without permission, even if it educates, celebrates and fosters interest and knowledge in nature.
One anonymous London tree name chalker said: Ill keep labelling as I go on my daily walks. I think its really tapped into where people are right now.
Botanical chalking gives a quick blast of nature connection, as the words encourage you to look up and notice the tree above you, the leaves, the bark, the insects, the sky. And thats all good for mental health. None of us can manage that much  living through a global pandemic is quite enough to be getting on with. But its brought me a great amount of joy.

UK Plantlife spokesman Trevor Dines said the charity could not condone breaking the law, but added: The incredible response to graffiti plant names is astonishing and I think its part of something profound. Its as if the plant is declaring its own place in our world.
In a recent YouGov poll, just 6% of 16- to 24-year-olds were able to correctly name a picture of a wild violet. The same poll showed nearly 70% of respondents would like to be able to identify more wild flowers.



With less spraying and weeding, we might expect to see up to 400 plant species on walls and paths, he suggests. That is 10% of our wild flora richness.
One survey of pavements in Sheffield found 183 different plants, another in Cambridge found 186 species on walls. All these little micro niches build up to a wonderfully complex tapestry, Dines said.
Every flower counts and will be targeted by pollinators  a patch of nettles can be swamped with caterpillars. And birds-foot-trefoil, a not uncommon urban verge plant, is a food plant for more than 160 different invertebrates. If we change our perceptions and see the dandelion flower for what it is  an absolute lifeline to our bees in early spring  we might learn to love them more.
A study by pollinator researchers revealed that many wild urban weeds rank very highly for the quantity of nectar and pollen each flower provides, often much higher than a variety of garden plants. The top trumps among the plants they measured included dandelions and their lookalikes  rough hawkbit, cats-ear and sow-thistles  plus ragwort, vipers bugloss, mallows, self-heal, scentless mayweed, love-in-a-mist, wild mignonette, rosebay willowherb, thistles, creeping buttercup and poppies.

Andrew Whitehouse, of conservation trust Buglife, said path and wall plants are also important as winter food sources when there is less blossom available for insects such as bumblebees. Below the concrete, the roots create tiny microhabitats that support woodlice, worms, harvestmen, spiders, baby slugs and snails, which in turn become the food for birds and hedgehogs, he added.
Cllr Jon Burke, of Hackney Council, which has gone pesticide-free in some areas and halved its use overall to increase wild flowers and boost insect biodiversity following public concern, said: It is absurd that this chalking of plant names is criminal. It is something we welcome as an important and inspiring teaching tool for adults and children. How else will a kid ever know these names? The vocabulary of the natural world helps us access it, love it and desire to protect it.
Criminal law expert James Gray of Drystone Chambers confirmed that chalking plant names in the UK is illegal without permission or lawful excuse and a rebel botanist could be fined up to 2,500 for painting or inscribing any picture, letter, sign, or other mark on a path, highway surface, tree or other structure.

Referring to Victor Hugos famous fictional police inspector, Gray added: The Javerts of this world will see great harm in the scribbles of rogue botanists and call for prosecutions, others will see it as entirely harmless and perhaps even a refreshing diversion in our streets.

He added: Where the threshold lies will depend on the attitude of those charged with enforcing the law; beauty (or derangement) is in the eye of the magistrate.

In a letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the shadow minister for mental health, Rosena Allin-Khan, said staff needed access to PTSD support and talking therapies, and that monitoring for increased suicide risk should be put in place. NHS and care staff are breaking down  I see it first-hand, working shifts. It is simply heartbreaking to see the toll this virus is taking on our frontline staff, she said. Our frontline NHS and care staff are doing fantastic work in extremely difficult circumstances. They risk their lives every day in order to protect us. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe. Allin-Khan wrote that staff are under increased pressure due to a fear of spreading the virus to patients and loved ones, PPE shortages and witnessing the deaths of patients. At this time of crisis, staff mental health must be a priority now. It simply cannot be an afterthought once the acute stage of the crisis is over.  Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, the national mental health director for NHS England, confirmed that the NHS was planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. We know its been a high-stress environment. Were planning mental health support right now, she said. She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. The military are very good at this, she said. Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as Samaritans, had been set up to support staff. Responding to MPs questions, Murdoch also said there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm. We absolutely have not seen that, she said. Were pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyones more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less. The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern. Early detection is vital for survival, she said. She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. There have been no national instructions on screening, she said. Its important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on.  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

Allen and Kuti had been playing together for the best part of eight years at this point, mixing highlife and jazz, but a 1969 trip to the US proved pivotal, exposing Kuti to the radicalism of the Black Panther movement and leading to the formulation of his militant aesthetic Africa 70 band. On the title track of Kutis second album to be recorded after the trip, Allen takes centre stage with his undulating groove, slapping the snare on the jaunty offbeats to counter Kutis forceful diction. An enticing taste of things to come. Fela Kuti: Water No Get Enemy (Expensive Shit, 1975)   Fela Kuti: Water Get No Enemy  video  Afrobeat rhythms seem deceptively simple: a steadily paced, off-kilter shuffle that holds the beat without succumbing to the western convention of landing the snare on the third beat of the bar. Try to play an Allen line, though, and you soon realise how much ghosting and embellishment is going on below the surface  doubles splayed on the first note of a phrase, kick drums scattered throughout. And yet, the groove remains even when it feels like it might fall apart. Water No Get Enemy is the perfect example: a hip-swaying mid-tempo horn line sits atop Allens liquid shuffle while Kuti uses the amorphous imagery of water to outline methods of resistance to Nigerias reactionary government. Fela Kuti: Zombie (Zombie, 1976)   Fela Kuti: Zombie  video  By the mid 70s, Kutis politics of resistance was reaching its peak. Zombie was its most forceful expression, Kutis lyrics characterising the violent Nigerian army as mindless zombies. You can feel the force of his frustration through his blistering saxophone as it meanders over the highlife guitar line, while Allens snappy, shaker-heavy rhythm is the ever-reliable foundation for Kutis social message. The songs success in Nigeria was not without consequences, leading to a severe beating for Kuti, the torching of his studio and his elderly mother being thrown from a window and killed. Tony Allen: Nepa (Never Expect Power Always, 1984)    Kuti had a domineering relationship to his bandmates, demanding all recording royalties for himself despite Allens role as musical director. As the 70s wore on and the groups popularity increased, so did the dissent in its ranks. By 1979, Allen had recorded three albums as bandleader and so decided to leave the Africa 70, taking many of its members with him. The greatest recording of his new era is 1984s Nepa  an attack on the notoriously unreliable Nigerian Electrical Power Authority. Here Allen continues Kutis lineage of playful socio-political criticism, this time updating the Afrobeat sound to include dub-inflected electronics and fusion funk. It would become representative of Allens all-encompassing musical appetite in the years to come. The Good, the Bad & the Queen: The Good, the Bad & the Queen (The Good, the Bad & the Queen, 2007)    As the 90s continued and Allen was establishing himself as an architect of Afrobeat in his own right, especially in the wake of Kutis 1997 death, his own genre-eating journey was evolving further into electronics and collaboration. A longtime fan of the genre, Damon Albarn enlisted Allen for his supergroup, The Good, the Bad & the Queen, featuring the Clashs Paul Simonon on bass and the Verves Simon Tong on guitar. The sprawling title track is the closest we see Allen to cutting loose behind the kit and producing an unabashed rock sound behind Tongs voluminous closing solo  a testament to his energetic versatility. Moritz von Oswald: Sounding Line 1 (Sounding Lines, 2015)   Moritz von Oswald: Sounding Line 1  video  Perhaps the strangest and least well-known of Allens collaborations is that with the techno producer Moritz von Oswald, who replaced his longtime drummer Vladislav Delay with Allen for his 2015 album Sounding Lines. Allen produces a truly remarkable sound: a warped and manipulated series of electronics. The opening track sees Allen superimpose an Afrobeat shuffle on to a wobbly dub that builds over 10 minutes to create a simmering, electro dancefloor odyssey. Tony Allen: A Night in Tunisia (A Tribute to Art Blakey and the Messengers, 2017)   Tony Allen: A Night in Tunisia  video  Allens first love was always jazz and he referenced throughout his life the work of rhythmic mastermind Max Roach and explosive powerhouse Art Blakey as major influences. This 2017 Blue Note recording was a welcome opportunity for Allen to finally delve into those roots and lay down his own interpretations. Across its four tracks Allen tackles some of Blakeys best-loved tunes, like a straight-eighths Moanin, but his Afrobeat-inflected Night in Tunisia is a work of genius, transforming the horn line into a punchy, driving vamp. Tony Allen: Wolf Eats Wolf (The Source, 2017)   Tony Allen: Wolf Eats Wolf  video  Continuing his jazz explorations, Allen delivered his first album of original compositions as a bandleader for legendary jazz label Blue Note. The culmination of his decades of musical exploration, it interweaves metallic electronics with warm percussion, bright horn lines and that ever-present drum language. On Wolf Eats Wolf, Allen is comfortably experimental, putting a Synclavier to work over a highlife guitar line and Kuti-referencing horns to create an eminently danceable new jazz standard.

Largely formulated for modular live performances, the record has a wonderfully loose, improvisatory feel.

Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to implement huge economic stimulus packages. Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future  and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution. The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis. The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the C40 group of cities, said: Our immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we must also look towards how we will keep our people safe in the future. How we structure our recovery efforts will define our cities for decades to come. The mayors discussed measures ranging from huge retrofitting programmes to make buildings more energy efficient, to mass tree planting and investment in solar and wind power. The mayor of Montral, Valrie Plante, who attended the video meeting, said: We need more than ever to position our economic recovery in the context of our fight against climate change. It is also clear to me that our economic recovery must go hand in hand with our social recovery. Milan has introduced one of Europes most ambitious cycling and walking schemes, with 22 miles of streets to be transformed over the summer. In Paris, the mayor has allocated 300m for a network of cycle lanes, many of which will follow existing metro lines, to offer an alternative to public transport. In Bogot, the Colombian capital, a 75-mile network of streets usually turned over to bicycles one day a week will now be traffic-free all week, and a further 47 miles of bike lanes are being opened to reduce crowding on public transport and improve air quality. New York has unveiled plans to open up 100 miles of streets for socially responsible recreation during the Covid-19 crisis, with a focus on areas with the most need, while Oakland, in California, is closing off 75 miles of its streets to passing cars and setting aside up to 10% of streets for recreation. Mexico City is planning 80 miles of temporary bike lanes, and Barcelona is adding 30,000 square metres to its pedestrianised networks and 13 miles to the biking network. In the UK, the Scottish government has announced 10m to create pop-up walking and cycling routes, while mayors in northern England have suggested a national programme to retrofit homes with renewable energy technology. On Thursday Manchester city council announced it would pedestrianise part of Deansgate, in the city centre. In London, boroughs including Lambeth and Hackney have announced measures to widen pavements, close roads to traffic and improve walking and cycling. Dr Rachel Aldred, at the University of Westminster, said the action city leaders take in the next few weeks would be critically important. This is a really important moment. There is the potential to lock in the reduction in air pollution we have seen over the past weeks if we get this right, but as people begin to go back to work and cant or dont feel safe using public transport, there is the potential to instead lock in a huge increase in car use and pollution. Mark Watts, the chief executive of C40, said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. There is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential, he said. We are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings  C40 cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns. Watts said although many of these initial measures had been billed as short term, he expected them to endure. This is how cities are going to function for the next two years, and probably that will transition  if we have a green economic recovery  into permanence. Daisy Narayanan, the director of urbanism at Sustrans, agreed that the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis could be a catalyst for long-lasting change in the way we live and travel, especially in towns and cities. What Covid-19 has also done is to highlight the crossovers between the quality of our places, public health, economy, transport, education, air quality and social justice. In recent weeks scientists have tentatively linked air pollution to Covid-19 mortality rates and even the spread of the virus. Narayanan added: Action needs to be taken now which will help people move around without the congestion, pollution and ill-health that comes with car use now and after lockdown is lifted. Seven things city leaders can do to drive a green, fair recovery from Covid-19  Remove through motor traffic from residential streets and extend pavements near shops, schools and parks to make walking safe and enjoyable for transport and exercise. Introduce safe access routes on foot, bike and scooter from homes to parks and green spaces and introduce automatic pedestrian lights at crossings so people do not have to push buttons and risk infection. Establish safe cycle routes to and from work for key workers, especially hospital staff, by closing roads and carriageways where necessary so people have a safe alternative to private cars and public transport. Create safe walking and cycling routes to and from schools, and close down streets around schools to motor vehicles at drop-off and pickup times. Use libraries, schools and sports stadiums to distribute nutritious, sustainably produced food to communities that need it most, and scale up food waste collection and treatment, including distributing household composting kits and guidance. Retrofit all public buildings, many of which are empty now, drastically improving energy efficiency and creating thousands of green jobs. Work with other cities to invest the billions tied up in city funds and pensions in climate solutions to drive green job creation and create a more resilient and sustainable economy. ","1122"
"2020-05-01T13:13:34Z","commentisfree","Opinion","The UK was a global leader in preparing for pandemics. What went wrong with coronavirus?","Its difficult to imagine that Britain was, until very recently, regarded as a leader in preparing for pandemics. Countries such as Singapore once looked to the UK for lessons in how to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. Now, its the other way around. With its number of coronavirus cases exceeding 170,000, and deaths set to climb above 40,000, the UK appears to be playing catch-up with the rest of the world. Britains failure to shatter the coronavirus curve couldnt be further out of step with its past reputation as a leader in this area. The UKs global health strategy, launched under New Labour in 2008, was a game-changer in the field of global health. The strategy identified how, in an interconnected world, an infectious outbreak in another country was a direct threat to the UK. By building health capacity elsewhere in the world, the government recognised that it could protect its own borders from infectious outbreaks  reflecting the Blairite logic that interventions abroad would bolster security at home. Over the past two decades, the UK has been a trailblazer in funding global health. Its one of the only countries to have 0.7% of GDP earmarked for overseas development assistance. Public Health England has a global team advising countries across the globe in building capacity to respond to disease, while the UKs public health rapid support team is frequently deployed around the world to support countries response efforts to emerging pathogens. During the Ebola crisis in 2014, for example, the government deployed PHE epidemiologists to work with Sierra Leones health ministry, while the Ministry of Defence sent troops to build treatment centres and NHS staff volunteered as healthcare workers. Meanwhile DfID supported clinical trials of vaccines, in collaboration with UK universities. Of course, the UKs interests in this field were never just about health. Its 2008 strategy was criticised at the time for self-interest  pursuing health policies abroad primarily as a means of protecting the UK from infection, and as a trade opportunity to commodify NHS expertise on the international market. In the febrile political climate that followed 9/11, the threat of an attack  whether in the form of a virus or a terrorist group  loomed large in governments imaginations. The UK government saw policies to combat infectious diseases as an extension of this security mindset  in turn shaping how politicians came to view pandemics. This fear of existential risks forged the UKs global health strategy, but it also helps explain why we found ourselves on the back foot when coronavirus hit. By the time Covid-19 arrived, the memory of such dangers taking place at home had faded; outbreaks seemed like things that happened elsewhere in the world. The last major outbreaks to affect the UK were BSE in the early 1990s and the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001. While these both posed significantly less of a risk to human mortality than Covid-19, they contributed to widespread disruptions and substantial economic losses for farmers. By the time the last foot-and-mouth case had been recorded, in Cumbria, more than six million cattle, pigs and sheep had been slaughtered. Yet in the years that followed these crises, successive governments became complacent  believing they could get away without funding preparedness, as outbreaks were unlikely to happen within their election cycle, if at all. This complacency was amplified by austerity policies. The NHS has endured the most prolonged funding squeeze in its history, which has meant that surge capacity in PPE, ventilators and ICU beds was not purchased, even when Operation Cygnus identified these areas as shortcomings in 2016. Meanwhile the UKs cuts to investment in public health areas such as smoking, alcohol and obesity have contributed to a rise in entirely preventable chronic conditions, which are now proving significant risk factors for coronavirus. One of the few existential dilemmas the UK has faced over the last decade is Brexit. Somewhat paradoxically, in prioritising Brexit, government ministers dealt another blow to the UKs preparedness for a threat whose consequences would be deadly. Training for key workers to manage a pandemic was stalled to make space for contingency plans around no-deal Brexit, while the UK missed opportunities for EU-level purchasing of PPE, and parliamentary enquiries into preparedness for infectious disease were delayed and eventually halted due to the 2019 election. Early in the pandemic, the UK made the significant  and potentially fatal  decision to ignore the advice of the WHO, an institution for which the UK is still a top government funder, which recommended a strategy of testing, isolating and contact tracing. This early move now seems like a grave mistake. Jenny Harries, Englands deputy chief medical officer, stated that the UK didnt need to follow WHO advice  The clue with the WHO is in its title  its a World Health Organization, and it is addressing all countries across the world, she said at the time. But the assumption that WHO guidelines didnt apply to us exposed a remarkable hubris in the UK governments approach to coronavirus. We were no better prepared than the rest of the world. Indeed, we were worse prepared than countries that once looked to us for lessons. On matters of pandemic preparedness, why would any government seek the UKs advice again?

Fifteen per cent are stuck on campus because travel regulations prohibit them from returning home. The remaining 85% are attempting to work remotely without access to campus buildings or support from peers.  The good news is that if youre able to self-motivate now, its a skill you can use for the rest of your life. Lockdown has disrupted our normal routines, and the devastating impact of Covid-19 has left many of us contemplating our own mortality. Thats inevitably led to some searching questions about what life is all about.   Related: Campus lockdown: how to cope alone in university halls   This is actually a valuable use of our time: people who understand what drives them are not only better placed to make choices which will serve their wellbeing and happiness, theyre able to motivate themselves even if the task at hand is unappealing, dull or repetitive (see: revision). Most people never deeply consider what motivates them. After all, society provides compelling goals for us to aspire to from the moment were born  whether thats earning money above and beyond what we need to survive, buying stuff we dont need, making ourselves resemble societys narrow beauty paradigms, or getting followers on social media. But as any celebrity will tell you, achieving these goals rarely results in genuine fulfilment. Conversely, if our key psychological needs  purpose, belonging, achievement, love and connection  are being met and whatever we have dedicated our life to honours our driving force, were much more likely to feel content, energised and motivated. The most common driving forces I encounter are a desire to make a difference, community and socialising, freedom and independence, fairness and justice, and competition. Most people are galvanised to an extent by all of the above, but theyll have a dominant motivator. If youre having trouble working out which yours is, there are two tests Id recommend. First of all: whats your desert island object and what does it represent to you? If, for example, the answer is your phone, it could represent the ability to communicate with others. Your driving force might be socialising and community. Secondly: when was the last time you were incandescent with rage over something that, in the general scheme of things, didnt matter that much? For instance, if someone pushed in front of you in a queue two weeks ago and youre still having imaginary conversations with them in your bathroom mirror, your key value might be fairness. Once youve identified your driving force, its a case of making the task youre dreading match your motivation.  Lets say youre driven to make a difference. You could do a shout-out to see if anyone on your course is struggling with an aspect of studying or a particular module, and challenge yourself to explain it to them. Youre revising, but also helping others. If socialising is your thing, three or four of you could pledge to go over the material and present different parts of it to one another over Zoom or Skype. If you can make it entertaining, all the better.   Related: How to study at home during coronavirus by online students and tutors   Competitive people are most enthused when in competition with themselves, so time yourself doing a past paper and then see if you can beat your own record. If you can get a competitive person into an online social study group theyll also likely ensure you all remain on track. One day, lockdown will be over and well be tasked with attempting to get back to normal, but its shrewd to remain aware of your driving force. After all, as a psychologist once told me: Your key value is freedom. If youre chained to the same desk for 12 hours a day youll never be happy, no matter how many zeros are on the end of your salary.

"2020-05-01T13:00:09Z","commentisfree","Opinion","'Incel' culture has sparked panic and pity – but little thoughtful conversation","They say one of the first signs of indoctrination is the inability to take into consideration any outside viewpoints. All news and information starts to be filtered through one ideological point of view, and the indoctrinated surround themselves only with people who share that point of view. I think, then, we can safely say that the media has been indoctrinated. Incapable of discussing the epidemic of loneliness and alienation that gets lumped in with incel culture (incel stands for involuntary celibate) it can only swing between hysterical condemnation  these young men are fighting a war against women  or soft-hearted (and -headed) pity: all these men need is a girlfriend and a better job. File the new film TFW No GF, which is named after a meme that refers to feeling alone (that feel when no girlfriend), under the soft-hearted side of things. The documentary, which was supposed to debut at the now canceled SXSW festival and was unveiled this week on Amazon Prime, is ostensibly a portrait of male loneliness and disenfranchisement in struggling post-industrial cities from the forgotten regions of America. It profiles several young men who have grown up with unfettered access to gore and hardcore pornography and notoriously rules-free message boards such as 4chan, which is routinely accused by experts of being a hotbed of alt-right radicalization and misogyny.   Related: Why do we only care about incels when they are men? | Arwa Mahdawi   The film also seeks to examine how the privilege of white manhood is pretty much a fantasy when separated from structures like wealth, higher education, and urban, coastal centers. The men are all white, un- or under-employed, and often grew up in difficult family circumstances. They spend a lot of time making inappropriate  but sometimes quite funny  jokes on social media. (My favorite: Dear Isis, please execute every non-incel.) At first viewing, TFW No GF seems like an empathetic, if not well structured or contextualized, view of a much maligned but probably pretty harmless group of guys. By harmless I mean that, for the most part, the alienated young men of America pose a greater threat to themselves  via suicide and addiction  than to others. Of course, when they do lash out at others, the results are sometimes horrifying acts of violence, often against women. One of the films producers is Cody Wilson, a self-defined crypto-anarchist. His various run-ins with the law include pleading guilty to endangering a child after being brought up on charges of paying a minor for sex and a legal battle with the feds after he released blueprints online for creating a firearm by 3D printer. Wilson is also one of the founders of Hatreon, a crowdsourcing platform favored by white nationalist groups kicked off Patreon for violating their terms regarding hate speech. So, yeah. Whatever his motivations for producing the film, its safe to say they are probably highly questionable. But should that mean we shouldnt watch it? After the 2016 election, there was a lot of talk about intellectual bubbles. Given free rein to choose from the multitude of media sources, voices, and communities to listen to, we tend to go with those we already agree with, getting no outside perspective. But while the leftist bubble was deemed a problem because it left its inhabitants naive about what was happening in Trump country, only the more conservative bubble was deemed dangerous. On the right, terrorists and reactionaries were being created, but its not like they had anything those on the left needed to know. If anything, the left just needed to infiltrate, so it could teach and help those trapped on the right.   There is so much misinformation and heightened emotions around this subculture that any real conversation is nearly impossible   But whatever the politics of these young men  the documentarys makers largely omit politics from the conversation, framing the subjects as simply trolls and reflexive antagonists  they do offer some useful insights. The alienated generally do. Their observations on the way America presents itself as a meritocracy, yet saves its rewards for people with money, family connections, and good looks, are important. The memes and jokes and insults they create might not reach the level of Dostoevskys Notes from Underground, but they have some shared sensibility. The alienated young men of America deserve a better intermediary than a previous international fugitive. The director, Alex Lee Moyer, has described herself as red-pilled. The musician who wrote the score, Ariel Pink, has a long history of edge-lordy political comments  always carefully packaged in irony and plausible deniability. The greatest failing of the documentary is the way it pretends 4chan and other gathering places for this particular subculture are mostly harmless, perhaps populated with a few bad eggs. (By bad egg, I of course mean mass murderers.) One character in the documentary refers to boards where people say theyre going to kill themselves, either as a confession or as a joke, and other users will sometimes encourage the user to follow through. Its funny, he tells us, except that maybe someone will be sincere and actually die. Except thats not a maybe  one user actually livestreamed his suicide attempt for 4chan. If you want to talk about a subculture, talking about its dark sides and limitations in a serious way is more helpful than pretending everything is fine. But what if that is part of the films agenda? There is so much misinformation and heightened emotions  the kind that caused authorities across the country to go into high alert because of a comic-book movie  around this subculture that any real conversation about incels is nearly impossible. Were always afraid of alienated figures, because of what they reveal about a society that works for some of us. These young men refuse to go through the motions of pretending the meritocratic American Dream isnt rigged. That makes those of us with merit nervous. Were afraid of what they might do instead.

The days feel 43 hours long, and I am endlessly bored. Just yesterday, I went through our treat cupboard and found a two-year-old packet of flying saucers nobody wanted. I hoovered them up as if I were auditioning for Oliver Twist. I cannot concentrate when we are watching television because I am internally debating which breakfast cereal I am going to have as a late-night snack, while also weighing up whether I can be bothered to go and get it. I dont foresee these eating habits changing any time soon, which means it has become imperative that I maintain an exercise regime. I tried jogging, and almost immediately decided it is for people who hate themselves. Then my wife suggested we do a Zoom fitness class. A lot of us are unaware of the variety of people affected by this situation, and fitness instructors have been hit hard. I do want to take this opportunity to say that I dont think theyre suffering the most, because we have entered a phase where expressing empathy for anyone risks somebody else calling you out (So you dont give a shit about the NHS workers or the elderly, you filth!). But the point I am trying to make is that it felt good to support someone whose income has been decimated. Yes, I only paid a fiver, but it is now possible to accept a hero credit for the smallest things: I can say I am doing my bit for local businesses by ordering a Deliveroo, and last week I was proud of myself for using an instrument during the clap for the NHS. My wife and I signed into the class, and I was immediately struck by the fact that this was far more exposing than doing one IRL. Everyone could see everyone, right in front of them, rather than being in among them, and I found myself wishing we had thought more carefully about the framing of our shot. Its difficult to look very committed when your backdrop features 11 pizza boxes. I became paranoid about how untidy our house looked compared to the others, and realised how naive wed been: the real workout is getting yourself and that bit of your house ready. I selected gallery view, where you see everyone else in a grid. But for all I knew, the others stuck with the default view, which has the person speaking taking up the majority of the screen. This is fine in principle, except that it cuts to whoever makes any kind of noise. I muted us immediately, so that the screen didnt cut to our house after an involuntary grunt or rogue fart.   Related: A family walk should be a way to defuse lockdown tensions.

There was the added issue that I apparently look ridiculous when performing any physical activity. My wife claimed the biggest challenge for her was trying to keep a straight face during my burpees (an exercise that no level of physical improvement can make worthwhile). Despite all this, we will be doing it again. It is tough, and we have to tidy up beforehand, but last night I ate an entire Christmas pudding. Failure is not an option.","586"

It also features a green monkey. But whether it is the moment for Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question. Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson seniors 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as a tireless self-promoter.    The Marburg Virus by Stanley Johnson. Photograph: HANDOUT   Long out of print, the book is based on a real disease outbreak in Germany in the late 1960s. Johnson denied being opportunistic in wanting his novel to be made available again. Im a professional writer, he said. Is it opportunistic for journalists and newspapers to be writing about the coronavirus? He pointed to his previous thrillers which have also tackled contemporary issues, including his latest book Kompromat, which tells a story of devious Russian influence on western politics. Johnson said his novel had a prescience, in that the plot was driven by the desperate need to find a vaccine. I dont think the novel is far fetched because look at what is happening now, he said. The novel is a pacy environmental and medical adventure story involving illegal animal traders, corrupt pharmaceutical company bosses, the KGB and a US president desperate to come out on top. In Johnsons story, the equivalent of Wuhan is New York, the virus breaks out at the Bronx zoo. Soon the rest of the world bans planes travelling from the US. The main characters are involved in a desperate attempt to track down a rare breed of green monkey, which was the source of the virus. Some subplots are more improbable than others. One involves the Brazilian head of the World Health Organization and his deputy, a sinister, monocle-wearing Russian with an upper-class English accent, travelling to the Congo to personally oversee the destruction of monkeys responsible for the virus  or so they thought. Johnson said there were lessons to be learned from his story because he thought more effort should be being made today to tracking down the source of the current pandemic.    The 2015 US version of the novel, The Virus. Photograph: HANDOUT   Instead of focusing on the Wuhan wet market, I think people should be looking for some release of the virus via an animal being used in the secretive Wuhan research laboratory, he said, in remarks echoing Donald Trumps so far unsubstantiated claim to have seen evidence that the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Then of course the race will begin to find where the animal or batch of animals came from so that a world-saving vaccine can be developed in record time. The pitch to UK publishers by Johnsons literary agent, Jonathan Lloyd of Curtis Brown, urges publishers to purchase what he describes as an unnervingly prophetic, intelligent thriller. It continues: When a young woman in New York City dies mysteriously after a trip to Europe, top epidemiologist Lowell Kaplan identifies the cause of death as the Marburg virus  a fatal strain that has surfaced only once before in history. Determined to trace the source of the disease, Kaplan follows a trail of intrigue from the labs of Germany to the jungles of central Africa. Lloyd is looking for a publisher who can capitalise on the wonderful opportunity Stanleys profile presents and make this urgent, exhilarating novel quickly available to his wide audience, at a time when it feels eerily prescient, he writes. The pitch describes Johnson as an excellent, tireless self-promoter and it hopes publishers can agree that this is an exciting opportunity to have this book back in print again (firstly as an e book). The book was published in the US in 2015 with the title The Virus but it remains to be seen whether UK publishers will bite. Johnson said Amazon was charging 57 for the paperback edition. All the more reason to produce a new version now, he said. I do hope it happens  I had such fun writing it. Reviews of the novel are sparse and mixed. On Goodreads coverage ranges from praise for its breakneck action to a less glowing response: Made it about a third of the way through this before I got too annoyed with its stupidity and quit. But another reader on the site noted the books possible prescience in 2015: The scariest thing is, because we live in a scary world, I can totally envision every bit of it happening. They also said they had received a copy directly from the author.

He pushed back a lock of thick greying hair which had fallen over his forehead and hunched forward as he spoke, the suppressed energy visible in every line of his body. Okay, he shouted into the phone. It differs from A-Brazil, but does it have pandemic potential? Thats the question.   She pleaded with him. Lowell, dont go. Not now. I need you tonight. They made love in a brass four-poster bed which Stephanie had bought in an antique shop off Les Halles when she first came to Paris. Kaplan stayed the night. They had breakfast in bed. Then, pushing the tray aside, they made love again. There was none of the urgency there had been the previous evening. It was though a dam had burst on a river. Now, after a temporary turbulence, the water was flowing smoothly again.   The Presidents reaction, once he was informed of the crisis, was immediate. Why in Gods name dont we have a vaccine? You people  he was addressing an emergency meeting of Federal and state health officials  have a vaccine for polio and flu and whooping cough and even the goddam common cold. So why havent you got a vaccine for Marburg if its the deadliest disease known to man? ","1038"

In wine terms, that could be a country, a region or a grape variety, particularly one you may have failed to get to grips with in the past, and the immediate one that pops to my mind is riesling. Now, before you say you wine writers are always banging on about riesling, thats true, but I wouldnt go so far as to call it the greatest white wine grape in the world (for me, thats chardonnay). It is, however, massively intriguing in the way it reflects the place where its made, its wildly varying levels of sweetness (no, its not all sweet) and its ability to age, which may mean that that elderly bottle you stumbled across at the back of the cupboard is, in fact, OK. Riesling also has the advantage of going brilliantly with spicy food and being relatively low in alcohol, which makes it perfect for this time of year. Part of the problem, of course, is that riesling is inextricably associated with Germany, so has to deal with the historic baggage between our two nations, though thats mercifully dying out, and not before time. Its also fair to say that the German wines exported here in the 60s and 70s  not always riesling, but often mistaken for it  were woefully poor. Add to that a bewildering labelling system (how can sptlese be both a dry and a sweet wine?), as well as tortuously complicated names and labels, and you can see why the stuff fell so out of favour. But German rieslings have changed: these days, theyre drier, higher in alcohol (many Mosel wines are now 11% or 11.5%, rather than 8-9%) and, in many cases, snappily packaged, as you can see from the Shhh Its Riesling in the panel below. And, hooray, sealed with a screw-cap rather than a cork. You also find great riesling in Alsace, Austria and in the new world in Australia, New Zealand and North Americas Washington State. The most rewarding ones, as usual, are to be found in independents such as The Winery, or online retailers such as The Wine Society, which has just started delivering again, though at time of writing only by the unsplit case. These supermarket rieslings should at least give you a taste for it, however. Who knows, you might even be able to convert the neighbours Five rieslings to try on your own (or drink with friends on Zoom)       Shhh Its Riesling 2019 6 Co-op, 11.5%. Ive been warned that there are limited quantities of this crisp, citrussy, dry riesling with its beguiling whiff of green granny smith apple, so grab one if you see it. I like a bottle that pokes gentle fun at itself.       Riesling Scheurebe Halbtrocken 2018 5.99 Lidl, 11.5%. A good buy from Lidls latest Wine Tour release, which focuses on riesling. Deliciously fruity but, as the word halbtrocken indicates, off-dry. Would stand up well to an Indian, Thai or Chinese takeaway. (Lidls lively, limey Clare Valley Riesling at 6.99 is a good buy, too.)       Specially Selected Alsace Riesling 2018 6.99 Aldi, 12%. A well-priced example of the drier style you find in Alsace. Would be perfect with creamy sauces or an onion tart.       Sainsburys Taste the Difference Austrian Riesling 2018 8.75, 12.5%. Austria also produces drier, less floral rieslings than Germany  a good starting point, if youre new to riesling. Lovely with a schnitzel or, more realistically, a breaded chicken fillet.       Fritz Willi Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium 2018 11.25 Rannoch Scott, 12.95 The Secret Bottle Shop, 11%. An altogether more elegant affair, seductively rounded, with a lovely touch of honey and lime.

The Bank said 34.1bn of loans had been advanced to firms during the month, the highest figure since records began in 1998.
The figures include new lending made under the governments coronavirus business interruption loan scheme and the Banks term funding scheme, put in place to support businesses during the crisis.
The annual rate of growth in borrowing by UK businesses rose to 8.2%, and within this borrowing by large businesses rose sharply, to 11.8%.
Deposits held by businesses rose by 34bn over the same period, and the Bank said changes in deposits and loans correlated closely across industries.
Meanwhile, new borrowing on credit cards and loans plummeted. New lending fell by 5.4bn over the month, resulting in the highest level of repayments recorded by the Bank since it started tracking the figures in 1987.
Credit card spending was down by 0.3% year-on-year  the first time the Bank has recorded an annual drop.
The fall is likely to be a reflection of the huge fall in consumer spending since physical distancing measures were introduced and households began to avoid shopping and leisure activities, rather than a sign that households are actively clearing debt. Deposits held in bank accounts leapt by 13.1bn, despite falling interest rates.
The Bank also noted a 1.3bn fall in repayments during the month, which could be a result of payment holidays being offered by banks and credit card providers to those who incomes have reduced by the crisis.
Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Economics, said the figures showed that private-sector demand for cash surged in March, as businesses and households battened down the hatches.
Data for April will provide a clear steer on whether businesses are collapsing, though Marchs figures are tentatively encouraging.
The Bank also reported a drop in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, with loans for both purchases and remortgages falling in March.
The number of house purchase loans fell by 24% to 56,200  the lowest level for seven years, while the number of remortgages was its lowest since August 2016, at 42,600.
In February, house purchase loans had hit a seven-year high and the market appeared to be geared for a year of rising activity and prices.



But it was, in effect, suspended in late March after ministers told would-be movers to delay their moves where possible. An estimated 373,000 sales are on hold.
The UKs biggest building society, Nationwide, said on Friday the housing market was grinding to a halt and warned it might not be able to produce its regular house price index over the coming months if there were too few transactions.
The lender reported a 0.7% increase in UK house prices in April, but said that 80% of the deals in its sample related to mortgage applications that started before the lockdown, and before the full extent of the impact of the pandemic became clear.
Robert Gardner, Nationwides chief economist, said the medium-term outlook for the housing market was highly uncertain, with much depending on the performance of the wider economy.
Economic activity is set to contract significantly in the near term as a direct result of the necessary measures adopted to suppress the spread of the virus, he said.







But the raft of policies adopted to support the economy, including to protect businesses and jobs, to support peoples incomes and keep borrowing costs down, should set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes, and help limit long-term damage to the economy.
Hansen Lu, a property economist at Capital Economics, said the rise in house prices would not last, and predicted a 4% drop over the year.



House prices are sticky  buyers may be seeking discounts in light of uncertainty and the economic hit from the pandemic, but owners wont accept unless forced to by worsening economic circumstances, he said.
This suggests that while house prices may appear resilient in the short term, as the economic hit from the pandemic continues, some owners will be forced to accept price cuts eventually.","707"
"2020-05-01T12:43:22Z","travel","Travel","Why UK holiday home owners are not giving refunds","When Campwell opened for the first time on 14 February, the outlook was bright  despite the horrendous weather. The woodland eco-site near Bath may have been lashed by storm Dennis but it was full that first weekend and forward bookings were fantastic according to founder Tim Bowles: It was really positive  we were already beyond our targets in terms of bookings and thinking we might even make a profit. Just over a month later, the UK went into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic and, like every other tourism business in the country, Bowles shut up shop. The outlook for his inaugural season went from bright to bleak. It hasnt been an ideal start, Bowles said, although he admits hes more fortunate than some. His landlord is a friend who is flexible about rent and two supervisors he employs have other work they can fall back on. But even without the pressure of meeting those costs, Bowles says its impossible for him to refund all his customers without putting the fledging business at risk. Most customers have been very accommodating and agreed to reschedule. We have refunded some people, but if we refunded everyone we would be on our knees. Theres a lot of talk on social media about how evil businesses are for not giving a refund, but its important to remember that these are small business that are dependent on these bookings  we are a very seasonal business and half our season has already been erased, added Bowles.    Tim Bowles (on the right) on the opening weekend of his Campwell eco-site in February Photograph: PR   He says he appreciates other people are going through financial difficulty too, but the timing of the crisis, coming at the beginning of the season, has been brutal. Unlike Airbnb, which announced full refunds or credits for guests who booked before 14 March (for stays up to 31 May)  a decision that hit individual owners hard  few small independent businesses have cash reserves to fall back on. In the first few months of the year, owners often use deposits to refurbish accommodation ready for the new season, so most have little money in the bank, and some are in debt. Easter bookings are relied on to inject some cash into the business. Mary and Simon Sparrow, owners of Hippersons Boatyard, a collection of four houseboats and a glamping pod in Suffolk, invested in a second pod this year to increase capacity for the 2020 season, leaving them with no financial cushion. People think we have loads of money behind us but we dont. We are now trying to plan ahead financially and considering cashing in our pensions. This year, Alistair Handyside, owner of Higher Wiscombe in south-east Devon, a collection of three cottages, invested 200,000 in the largest one. One week later, we went into lockdown and the business stopped dead, he said. In 15 years of running a business, weve had three cancellations. On 23 March, we had 16, so this is on a scale that is unprecedented. Handyside has already lost 80,000 in deferred business; if he is unable to accommodate guests in July and August that will rise to 140,000. Good businesses do not want to see customers missing out. If customers are being offered a full-value credit at a reasonable time  in other words, a fair swap, that is helping that business survive on really thin wages, said Handyside, who is also chair of the Professional Association of Self-Caterers (Pasc). In a survey of 900 accommodation owners in the south-west conducted by Pasc and the South West Tourism Alliance, 80% said they would collapse if they had no income through this summer, despite some of them receiving a grant of 10,000 and the prospect of government-backed rescue loans. For Handyside, the biggest frustration has been the failure of insurers to pay out. Most owners have business interruption insurance, but insurers are refusing coverage, he said. Its probably going to be one of the big scandals of Covid-19. The problem is being compounded by the failure of guests holiday insurance. Many holidaymakers are being told its up to their accommodation provider to compensate them, so holiday-home owners are becoming the insurer of last resort. The insurance scandal, as Handyside puts it, has left small businesses between a rock and a hard place. Many rely on repeat business from customers for the majority of bookings and do not want to jeopardise that loyalty but simply do not have the funds to refund everyone. Handyside said he is fortunate that his business is year-round, so there is a possibility of some recovery later in 2020, but seasonal businesses have already seen half their year wiped out. Its an absolute nightmare, said Jacqueline Saggers who, with her husband, runs Guilden Gate, a smallholding in Hertfordshire with two glampsites. They have refused all refunds: Not because we are being difficult but because we are a small family business and would go under if we did, and that doesnt help anyone. With only two sites, a VW van and a Hobbit-style shelter, she hasnt even been able to give all guests the alternative dates they want because that would mean even more loss of income: If we took everyone whos cancelled and put them in July and August, we would have no income. Were asking them to swap to September and October. Adding most guests are being very accommodating. The Saggers have received a 10,000 government grant but have to make it last until they can start operating again. As to when that might be, there is no clear indication from the government yet. On 28 April, minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, announced that tourist hotspots will be off-limits for some time to come. Two days later, prime minister Boris Johnson told the daily briefing that it was important to get tourism going again, but not to the extent that an influx of people would create a second wave of the disease. Johnson said a roadmap for unlocking various parts of the economy will be revealed next week but dates and times for each individual measure will be driven by where we are in the epidemic and what the data is saying.    The owner of Cambrian Escapes is working on the basis that the summers gone Photograph: PR   Duncan Jordan, owner of Cambrian Escapes near Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, which had been running for just under a year when the crisis struck, said: Were working on the basis that the summers gone. Were hoping it isnt, but when you hear the news, the work that needs to go in to helping people accept visitors and incomers into the community is huge. Others are more hopeful that tourism businesses will be able to operate at some level from July onwards. The worst case scenario is being shut down and not being able to operate until next year, said Malcom Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, a region where one in five jobs are in tourism and one in three homes depend in some way on the tourism sector. What we need is not to open a day too early or a day too late  we have to get this right, said Bell. There will be compromises: how do you make sure businesses are compliant? How do you give customer and community assurance? And how you minimise any risk to visitors? Measures currently being considered to ensure Cornwall can safely welcome visitors include timed-ticketing at attractions to control numbers, vehicle restrictions in towns to keep numbers of visitors at a manageable level, and even a change in the law requiring holidaymakers to have documentation proving they are allowed to visit. These might be seen as draconian, but lets not rule them out at the moment, said Bell. The alternative is to keep everything shut  but we have businesses in despair, its causing mental health issues. We have to come up with a solution to help the economy while minimising the risks to visitors and the community. In the meantime, owners facing the potential loss of their livelihoods are trying to stay positive. At the moment the land is heavenly. The wildlife is incredible, said Jacqueline Saggers at Guilden Gate. But I cant wait to be able to share it again with guests.","1352"

In the US, President Donald Trump continues to cause consternation among scientists
Trump, who previously shocked experts by suggesting injecting people with disinfectant could cure Covid-19  a dangerous idea that scientists and doctors were quick to debunk  has now claimed to have seen convincing evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab, contradicting his own government experts.







Once again, the scientific community has swiftly rebutted Trumps assertions.
Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: We have good evidence from the genomics research that the virus is not manmade, and the scientific world has very much moved on from this idea. It is unhelpful for high-profile individuals to repeat the debunked conspiracy theories, as it undermines the public health response.
There is cautious optimism around an experimental coronavirus drug
There are signs the antiviral medicine remdesivir  which has previously been used in Ebola patients  may be a useful tool in helping those with Covid-19. While it is not a cure, a new trial has suggested it can reduce the recovery time of those seriously ill with the disease.
Early results from an international trial of 1,000 participants reveal the drug cut recovery time from a median of 15 days to 11 and was also linked to a better chance of survival.

 Related: Remdesivir: the antiviral drug is being touted as a possible coronavirus treatment  but will it work? 

The findings come after results from a smaller trial among patients in China, that was cut short, initially suggested the drug had little effect.
What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus, said Dr Anthony Fauci, the US governments top infectious disease expert.
However experts have warned the drug is unlikely to be available widely in the UK any time soon, as it is very difficult to obtain, while they say the trials data must also be rigorously analysed and licensing approved.
In the last edition of Science Weekly, Sarah Boseley talks to Prof Helen McShane about why there has been interest in the tuberculosis vaccine and whether it could play a role in protecting us against Covid-19







In the UK, face masks continue to be a hot topic
Boris Johnson has said the UK has passed the peak in the outbreak and is planning to outline the countrys exit strategy next week. But the role of face masks for the general public remains contentious.
This week, Boris Johnson said face coverings will be useful going forwards, suggesting they may give people confidence when going back to work, while Scotlands first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the Scottish public should wear them in cases where it is difficult to maintain physical distancing, for example when shopping, although the guidance is not mandatory. However, she cautioned that people should not feel invincible when wearing a mask, or stop adhering to distancing guidelines.
Experts have previously said that while wearing face masks in the community may reduce the chance of an infected person spreading the virus, there is no evidence they reduce the chance of being infected, and may even offer a false sense of security. It is understood the UKs Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has similarly advised the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection.
However, some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the precautionary principle, adding these can be homemade, noting surgical masks should only be used by health and social care workers. Sturgeon has recommended the public use something like a scarf or bandana.

Doctors around the world are reporting a rare inflammatory condition in children
In countries including the US, France, Spain and the UK, doctors are reporting cases of children with an unusual, but potentially deadly, inflammatory syndrome that has been linked to Covid-19. According to doctors in Europe, children of all ages appear to show symptoms including fever, digestive problems and vascular inflammation.
Concerns were first raised in the UK after seeing a number of children admitted to intensive care with a combination of toxic shock and an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.
However, experts say the syndrome is rare.
Whilst this is an evolving situation, it is clear that these symptoms are reported in only handfuls of cases, said Dr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in paediatric intensive care in Cambridge. The important message is that if parents are worried about their childrens health, they should seek medical advice.

While progress is made with a coronavirus vaccine, doctors have raised concerns routine vaccinations are being missed
Doctors say they have seen a drop in uptake of routine vaccinations as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, raising concerns that could lead to outbreaks of other diseases such as measles.
In the US, MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) shots were down 50% in the week of 5 April, with diphtheria and whooping cough immunisations down 42%, while concerns have also been raised in the UK.
Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners in the UK said: Children can become very ill and die from the complications of common illnesses like measles that havent gone away. And immunisation is a fundamentally important part of preventing that from happening. We cannot allow delays in immunisations to go on for a long time, otherwise we really will see a crisis.","912"

"2020-05-01T12:36:27Z","world","World news","Lingering and painful: the long and unclear road to coronavirus recovery","Six weeks after first feeling unwell, Jenny* is still recovering from what she believes was Covid-19. 
On 17 March she, like many others, began preparing for an expected lockdown in the UK, stocking up on supermarket essentials. She was feeling a little flushed  something she put down to a reemergence of cold-like symptoms from a few weeks before.
Then the other symptoms began, including a runny nose, sneezing and phlegm. At that time, everybody was saying that runny noses and sneezing were not symptoms of coronavirus so I still didnt think I had it, the 33-year-old said. Then I started coughing.
As the days marched on, other symptoms developed, including chest pains, shortness of breath and marks like dappled bruising on the feet  something Spanish doctors have suggested could be a sign of the disease.
It really was like one thing after another, Jenny said, adding that on attempting to get back to work, typing in bed, she developed muscle pains in her wrists.
Her flatmate also became ill  with symptoms including a fever and loss of taste and smell. Without testing, it is impossible to be sure, but it seemed highly probable that the cause of the illness in both flatmates was Covid-19.
Jenny still feels exhausted, with days of feeling better followed by setbacks. I still dont feel better because a few days ago I started shivering, like I got a chill somehow, she said.
She is not alone: Fiona Lowenstein, a writer in the US, co-founded a group on the social media platform Slack for people who have experienced Covid-19 after it took her weeks to recover from being admitted to hospital with the disease.





Dr Andy Whittamore, a GP in Portsmouth and Asthma UKs clinical lead, says that viruses are a trigger for asthma and asthma symptoms, and therefore it is fair to assume that coronavirus will act in the same way.
Health bodies around the world are listing asthma as a condition that might be considered high risk, but so far there is no evidence to suggest that having asthma increases the infection rate from the coronavirus. There is, though, some evidence that people who have asthma and catch the coronavirus are more likely to go on to have a more severe case of Covid-19. There is yet to be any data which shows how asthma impacts on the mortality rate from the coronavirus, but doctors are advising that people with the condition try to manage their asthma symptoms as best they can in case they catch the coronavirus.
Asthma is a condition of the airways, causing inflammation. It can lead to wheezing, coughing and a tight chest, and be triggered both by internal factors in the body, like levels of hormones, and external factors, like viruses, pollution and allergens. Colds and flu are considered a major trigger.





Many report waves of symptoms over a period of weeks  from heart palpitations to headaches, shortness of breath and fatigue.
In a survey of group members, 89% of the 465 respondents said they had symptoms that fluctuated in intensity and frequency; 23% had tested positive for coronavirus, taking on average just over nine days to be tested from the onset to symptoms; 28% tested negative and were, on average, tested after about 15 days; and just 3.5% were admitted to hospital, although 38% visited an emergency department.
With symptoms long-lasting, some members have concerns over whether they are still infectious.
A report published in February by the World Health Organization, based on preliminary data, suggested in mild cases, the median recovery time from Covid-19 is about two weeks from the onset of symptoms, and about three to six weeks for severe or critical cases.
But while severe Covid-19 may mean a long road to recovery, it seems even mild cases can, for some, involve many weeks of recuperation.
Alice* is still experiencing symptoms more than 50 days after first becoming ill. Based in the UK, the 51-year-old said she joined the Slack group after reading an article by Lowenstein in the New York Times, and that finding the group was a big relief.
From 11 March, Alice experienced consistent severe fatigue, chest pain and tightness, and a cough  but no fever. Other symptoms came and went in waves, including chills, insomnia and heart palpitations. Day eight, nine, 10 was just really horrible, you are just concentrating on breathing and hanging in there, she said.


It is like a storm. One day you have zero symptoms  then it will just go crazy and as quickly as it hits you it can go.


By week four she felt on the mend, and began some work and to exercise  but then relapsed. Eventually she went to A&E. But despite being put in one of the hospitals coronavirus pods, and having various investigations, she was not tested for the virus, she said.
The symptoms continued to come and go, Alice said. It is like a storm. One day you can have zero symptoms  then it will just go crazy and as quickly as it hits you it can go. 
Lauren Nichols, 32, from Boston, Massachusetts, is another member of the Slack group. She has tested positive for Covid-19 twice and still has symptoms more than 50 days after first feeling unwell. She said the experience was a rollercoaster of symptoms and severities. 
My biggest concern is that there is little visibility into the reality of what recovery truly looks like, as recovery from a medical perspective simply means that the patient did not die and simply does not capture the lingering and painful symptoms that the Covid-19 recovery road truly entails for some or many, Nichols said, adding that some of her most alarming symptoms occurred in her third and fifth weeks of being unwell.
I am concerned that employers and governments are rushing the recoveries of thousands who are still in pain and still symptomatic, without understanding that this causes both mental and physical complications for people already in a very vulnerable and unwell state of being, she said, adding that she was also concerned about the lack of support for those recovering.
 
Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said it was perhaps not surprising that some people had long recoveries. Many people often take weeks to completely recover from pneumonia, he said. In these cases, the viral illness has typically long since subsided and thus it is unlikely the patient will be infectious.
But it is unclear why some take longer than others to recover. We know that recovery time after pneumonia is often influenced by the presence of co-morbidities and by age of the patient, said Head. Alongside that, many people will have undiagnosed co-morbidities, such as diabetes, also influencing how ill a patient becomes, and their recovery time.
The Slack group survey found two-thirds of respondents had a pre-existing medical condition, mainly seasonal allergies or asthma.
Why there should be such variation in recovery time remains unknown, but a genetic element may play a part, said Dr James Gill, an honorary clinical lecturer at the University of Warwick and a locum GP. Preliminary work from Kings College London has suggested that genetic factors could account for about half of the variation in a number of key symptoms of Covid-19.
Gill said he was only seeing about two to three patients a week with long-lasting symptoms, suggesting the experience is not common, although he noted that without community-level testing to know who had had the virus, it would remain unclear how common a recovery path was.
But Gill said data from the Sars outbreak revealed that almost a third of those who had had that particular coronavirus still had a reduced tolerance to exercise many months later, despite having normal lung function. While Gill stressed that Covid-19 was a different disease, he said it could be that a similar proportion of about a fifth or a third of those with Covid-19 had lengthy recovery time .



Although symptoms may linger, it is thought an individual is unlikely to be infectious once three days have passed with no raised temperature, but coughing should be treated with caution, Gill said.
What recovery looks like is an evolving picture, he continued. We are learning on a daily, weekly basis, things about how people are recovering from this, and we cant know about the long-term impacts until we are in the long term.


The only way to completely understand is by observation over the long term  and this includes recovery time.

Prof David Heymann



Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed with Gill. Whenever a new virus that has come from the animal kingdom is identified in humans there is great concern about what is not known because humans do not have previous experience with this virus and the immune response it will cause, Heymann said. The only way to completely understand is by observation over the long term  and this includes recovery time from infection. 
With suggestions that some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may arise after illnesses including viral infections, Gill said concern was starting to mount.
There are a lot of people wondering whether or not we are going to see an uptick in cases of chronic fatigue going forwards as a result [of Covid-19], he said. We dont know that, but it is something that we are thinking may be possible.
Carmine Pariante, a professor of biological psychiatry at Kings College London, agreed there could be a rise in people experiencing a CFS-like syndrome. We dont know if this is going to happen with Covid-19 because we dont have the follow-up data, he said. But the picture unfortunately, both in terms of the biochemical picture [of the immune response] and the acute fatigue, which is very prevalent, make us think it will be possible.
Gill said it was important that those who had had a coronavirus infection or suspected Covid-19, had access to physiotherapists and nutritional advice.
Also helpful would be leaflets with advice on recovery, such as reminding patients to drink plenty of fluids and to do breathing exercises, said Gill, adding that some advice could be drawn from existing knowledge of other conditions.
Ultimately, it is important to take time to recover, he said. If you have had coronavirus and you have been flattened by it, you have no get-up-and-go, and you are fatigued. You need to rest, and you need to go back to work  or doing whatever you do  in a step-wise progression.

Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, said he was concerned there had been discussions in government about giving schools and multi-academy trusts the flexibility and freedom to decide for themselves about reopening. In an interview with the Guardian, Roach said: What should not happen is that the government just simply sets a date for schools to be reopened, and then says to schools, to local authorities and multi-academy trusts, its over to you now to work out how we are going to deliver that. The government has a responsibility to have a clear and coherent plan around the reopening of schools which is led by the scientific evidence which does not result in a free-for-all, where individual schools make their own decisions which could compromise public health and the welfare of those working in schools.     Schools have been closed to all children, except those of key workers and those classified as vulnerable, since 20 March as part of national efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Roach and other union and school leaders have since been holding regular talks with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and department officials about how schools should respond to the pandemic. Roach, who took over as general secretary of the NASUWT in April, said: There have been discussions about leaving it up to schools to decide, in keeping with government policy over the last 10 years to increase freedoms and flexibility in the system. Weve been very clear its vitally important that the government take charge of the situation and they give schools clarity, certainly of what the national expectations are in relation to schools reopening and how schools should go about doing that. Conservative education policy has focussed in recent years on allowing greater flexibility and increasing school autonomy through its academies programme, which moves schools out of local authority control and into multi-academy trusts. Williamson told MPs on the education select committee on Wednesday that schools would reopen in phases and Boris Johnson has promised to set out further plans next week about how to ease lockdown restrictions. The government has said schools will reopen only when it is safe to do so. Roach said he was concerned, however, that ministers were coming under pressure from Conservative backbenchers and others to speed up the reopening of schools, which would allow parents back to work to help kickstart the economy.    We are asking ministers to resist that pressure and focus on the public health issues, said Roach. But that pressure may prove to be irresistible and ministers might move sooner rather than later to reopen schools in some form. Im sure theres a desire to see schools open this side of the summer break. From my point of view, whats critically important is that such decisions are taken on the basis of public health concerns, ensuring the health and safety of our members and pupils. Roach said it was still unclear how social distancing might work in schools, or whether personal protective equipment (PPE) would be available for staff who need it.","546"

A total of $28m is going to three coal mining companies, all with ties to Trump officials, bolstering a dying American industry and a fuel that scientists insist world leaders must shift away from to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.   Related: Covid-19 crisis will wipe out demand for fossil fuels, says IEA   The other $22m is being paid out to oil and gas services and equipment providers and other firms that work with drillers and coal miners. Melinda Pierce, the legislative director for the Sierra Club, said: The federal money Congress appropriated should be going to help small businesses and frontline workers struggling as a result of the pandemic, not the corporate polluters whose struggles are a result of failing business practices and existed long before Covid-19 entered the public lexicon. More than 40 Democratic lawmakers have argued that fossil fuel companies should not get any assistance under the coronavirus aid package. Some Democrats have also warned the forgivable loans being made under Congress Paycheck Protection Program could be a transparency disaster. Banks and lending institutions are distributing the money, so the government says it cannot track recipients in real time. The loans revealed have been made public only through news reports and securities filings by publicly-traded companies, although the Federal Reserve has committed to issuing monthly reports. So far, its clear the program is not working as intended. The funds are aimed at helping small businesses to keep paying their employees and covering other recurring expenses during the economic downturn. But they have been exploited by large companies forced to return the money amid a public outcry, including the Los Angeles Lakers, Shake Shack and Ruths Chris Steak House. The industry aid comes as the Trump administration is reportedly considering a broader bailout for oil and gas corporations, which were already under pressure before the coronavirus and have watched oil prices nosedive because of a global price war and low demand for gasoline. The US government could make loans to oil and gas companies, essentially making taxpayers investors in the industry. The Federal Reserve on Thursday also announced changes to its lending rules that could help indebted petroleum firms. The idea that oil workers are getting a paycheck is great, said Jamie Henn, a spokesman for the Stop the Money Pipeline campaign who co-founded the environment group 350.org. The worry is that the moneys going to the top and not going to filter down. The $50m already paid to fossil fuel companies is a small fraction of the the $2.1tn Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the Cares Act. But the total assistance to the industry is likely much larger than can currently be tallied and will continue to grow. Environmental advocates and oversight experts tracking the funds say its impossible to count how much of the money will assist fossil fuels, including because some firms provide services across multiple industries. All of this is voluntary disclosures by the companies, said Jesse Coleman, a senior researcher with Documented. No matter what, its going to be an incomplete picture of whats going on. Coleman said in many cases the fossil fuel companies getting aid have made bad investments and now theyre going to come crawling hat in hand and say: look at what the coronavirus did to us.   Its both a bad financial proposition of the Fed and for taxpayers, and a bad situation for the planet  Graham Steele    Among the coronavirus aid recipients is Hallador Coal, an Indiana-based coal mining company that hired Donald Trumps former environment chief Scott Pruitt as a lobbyist. The companys former government relations director now works at the energy department. Hallador is taking $10m to fund two months of payroll and other expenses. Coal mining company Rhino Resources, which was formerly run by Trumps Mine Safety and Health Administration head, David Zatezalo, is receiving $10m. Coal firm Ramaco Resources, whose CEO, Randy Atkins, is on the energy departments National Coal Council, is getting $8.4m. The US coal industry has been in steep decline, driven out of the market by cheap natural gas and environmental concerns. Trump campaigned on putting coal miners back to work, and his agencies have unsuccessfully explored ways to bail out coal companies, which are seeing their lowest employment levels in modern history. The Trump administration has also rescinded nearly all of the environment and climate protections the fossil fuel industry has opposed. Fossil fuel companies can also take advantage of tax benefits under the coronavirus legislation, including deferring payment of social security and medicare taxes. The Missouri-based Peabody Energy coal company has said it will speed up collecting an alternative minimum tax refund of $24m to 2020 and defer $18m of owed taxes. US taxpayers already subsidize the fossil fuel industry at roughly $20bn a year, according to conservative estimates. The Center for International Environmental Law has accused the oil, gas and plastics industries of exploiting the crisis by aggressively lobbying for massive bailouts and special privileges in a desperate attempt to revive an oil and gas industry already in decline. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis argues that federal lending to the oil and gas sector would be a complete waste of money, because it wouldnt fix the industrys underlying financial problems. Oil industry lobbyists have pushed for changes at the Federal Reserve to let companies with large amounts of debt use its Main Street Lending Program and borrow to pay off existing loans. In an 15 April letter to the Federal Reserve, the oil trade group the Independent Petroleum Association of America asked for the new provisions, saying oil and natural gas producers are not looking for a government handout; they are seeking a bridge to help survive this economic disruption. Environmental advocates say the move would disproportionately benefit small and mid-sized oil and gas companies, such as Occidental Petroleum, which has nearly $80bn in liabilities on its balance sheet.   Related: California closes Orange county beaches over Covid-19 fears  but how risky is a beach day?   Graham Steele, who directs the corporations and society initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, called the situation the classic disaster scenario where an opportunistic administration and industry is taking advantage of a crisis. And by the way, these are industries driving climate change. Its both a bad financial proposition of the Fed and for taxpayers and a bad situation for the planet.","1059"

Lawyers for Associated Newspapers had argued last month against elements including that some words and sentences from a letter by Meghan to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, had been dishonestly cut out before publication in order to paint a misleading picture of the relationship between the two. She is suing the newspaper group for misuse of private information, breach of data protection and copyright infringement after the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online, which it owns, published contents of the handwritten letter sent to Markle, 75, in August 2018. Associated Newspapers denies the claims. Delivering his ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Warby struck out allegations that the publisher had acted dishonestly by leaving out certain passages of the letter. He also struck out allegations that the publisher deliberately stirred up issues between Meghan and her father, and that it had an agenda of publishing intrusive or offensive stories about her. Those allegations should not form part of the duchesss case at this stage, he said, because they were irrelevant to her claim for misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. But he said those parts of her case may be revived at a later stage, if they are put on a proper legal basis. Some of the allegations are struck out as irrelevant to the purpose for which they are pleaded, said the judge in a written ruling. Some are struck out on the further or alternative ground that they are inadequately detailed. I have also acted so as to confine the case to what is reasonably necessary and proportionate for the purpose of doing justice between these parties. I do not consider that the allegations struck out on that basis go to the heart of the case, which at its core concerns the publication of five articles disclosing the words of, and information drawn from, the letter written by the claimant to her father in August 2018. Schillings, the law firm representing the duchess said the ruling made it very clear that the core elements of the case do not change, saying: The duchesss rights were violated; the legal boundaries around privacy were crossed. A spokesperson added: Whilst the judge recognises that there is a claim for breach of privacy and copyright, we are surprised to see that his ruling suggests that dishonest behaviour is not relevant. The action by the duchess focuses on five articles  two in the Mail on Sunday, and three on Mail Online  reproducing parts of the letters, with the headline on one reading: Revealed: The letter showing the true tragedy of Meghans rift with a father she says has broken her heart into a million pieces. During a hearing last month, which was heard remotely before a virtual court hearing in London, lawyers for Meghan accused the Mail of stirring up issues between the duchess and Markle, then using it to justify publishing a private and confidential letter. She was said to have been distressed at the realisation that Associated Newspapers had an agenda of intrusive and offensive stories about her. But counsel for the publisher argued that allegations of dishonesty and malicious intent were not relevant in a misuse of private information case. Claims that the newspaper had harassed, humiliated, manipulated and exploited her were remarkable given that she had not contacted her father to ask if he agreed, he added. The ruling was a total loss for Meghan, according to Mark Stephens, a libel and privacy expert at the law firm Howard Kennedy, who said that the judge had struck out a significant but ill-informed part of her claim. She now faced paying between 200,000 to 250,000 in costs for pursuing what he described as a wide-ranging attack on the media, and the prospect of being cross-examined during the case about the way she and friends curated her reputation. She had a very simple and quite strong  on the face of it  case of privacy, because it was a confidential letter written from an estranged daughter to an estranged father. It has now pared back to a privacy and copyright claim, Stephens added. Another lawyer, Jonathan Coad of Coad Law, said the newspaper had scored a tactical victory by paring down the claim, which he said had been over-egged in a way that had not stood up to the forensic scrutiny of the court. This will all contribute to the exertion of pressure by the MoS on Ms Markle to abandon her claim, he added. But the campaign group Hacked Off said that the judgment would make no difference to the substantial claim for misuse of private information. Nathan Sparkes, the policy director at Hacked Off, said: Harry and Meghan have been dragged through the mud by the Mail, which has waged a campaign of intrusion and abuse against Ms Markle in particular.","849"

Im weak enough to have seriously considered that my five-year-old is now physically stronger than me. When I hear core, all I think of is Andrea and her Irish singing siblings. So the idea of wearing a very heavy jacket like this sturdy biker one, gives me pause for thought. It will, I realise, force a rethink of how I move, and how I walk. But Im being open-minded about the style, because the biker jacket has come a long way. It was created by Irving Schott in 1928, in conjunction with Harley-Davidson, with a specific function in mind (belt buckles placed in certain places to protect you from the wind while riding; zippers for easy access). Marlon Brandos jacket in The Wild One was from this range. Brando helped move it to the mainstream, and since then its been loved by wrong uns, rebels, greasers and Ramones. About seven years ago, it became a womenswear staple, paired with a delicate dress. And then it went mass market: H&M, All Saints and Gap all produced their own versions, which varied widely in dimensions and style (quilted, studded, weird zip placement).

Four years on from the release of breakthrough record Teens of Denial, Toledo is back with new album Making a Door Less Open, only now he is going under the name Trait and is wearing a gas mask in photos. Toledos restless and impassioned indie rock is looking a little different, too. The new album blends his classic songwriting chops with a bold exploration of electronic textures. This is the result of essentially making the album twice: once as Car Seat Headrest, and again alongside producer Andrew Katz as their jokey EDM side project 1 Trait Danger, before landing on a middle ground.

The character is a way to be an embodiment of that energy rather than some schmuck with a microphone. He neednt be so bashful. By effectively collaborating with himself, Toledo has avoided the pitfalls of repetition and complacency; a trap that he recognises makes some bands sound conservative, amid a lack of tension between old friends who have become overly comfortable. Making a Door Less Open has also shown a new path for artists, who can now collaborate with their own alter ego.

"2020-05-01T12:00:53Z","commentisfree","Opinion","The north of England can't handle another recession. Coronavirus could sink it","Many of us, while nipping to the shop or on our daily walk, will find ourselves gazing into the dark, empty windows of pubs and restaurants, looking forward to the day when things go back to normal. But its becoming increasingly clear that the high street of six weeks ago is gone, as businesses struggle to pay rents with no income. Even successful pubs and restaurants are already being listed for sale. Were now starting to get the first tentative bits of economic analysis into where all the pieces may lie when things finally start picking up. And its very apparent that the north of England is about to hit serious economic trouble. Of the 20 places in Britain with the highest proportion of employees working in restaurants and pubs, 10 are in the north, and just five in the south. Indeed, research from the Royal Society of Arts this week found that chancellor Rishi Sunaks constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire could lose the most jobs, as 35% of his constituents work in hospitality. Naturally, very few parts of the UK will be spared serious damage. Yet, while the wealthier regions of London and much of the south could absorb the impact of another recession, there are a lot of indications that the north simply cannot go through that again. Figures show the south-west is taking enormous hits in this crisis too. But the south hasnt had quite the same economic battering over the past decade  between 2009-10 and 2017-18 public spending in the north dropped by 3.6bn, while rising 5.1bn in the south. The reality is that whole swathes of the north have still not fully recovered from the last financial crash. When the IPPR thinktank looked into the five-year progress of the Northern Powerhouse project last year, it found the number of children in poverty in the north had increased by 200,000 to 800,000, the jobs paid less than the living wage rose by 11%, and real-terms weekly pay increased by only 12 in the north compared with an average national rise of 19. So not only is the north-south productivity gap at Victorian levels thanks to decades of underinvestment and a brutal 10 years of austerity  it is actually getting worse. Northern councils are now warning of alarm bells over huge gaps in funding, as some are struggling to provide basic services. Most councils in Britain have already been stripped to the bone and, with no cushion, some are now considering bankruptcy. Put simply, theres nothing left to cut in the north. Another round of austerity would simply collapse many towns and cities that were already just scraping through. We have the developed worlds biggest regional economic divide, across virtually every measure. For our London-dominated politics its a simple case of out of sight, out of mind. Governments have a history of protecting the financial centre of London and the south-east. Despite the chancellors own constituency being hit badly, theres little indication that this time will be any different  which would be such a wasted opportunity. There are endless ways of investing in Britain that would support the whole of the UK and reduce the norths drag on the economy. The government could temporarily suspend the 20% VAT on food served in pubs and restaurants for the year after lockdown finishes, or remove tax on beer and wine. Just like Gordon Browns car scrappage scheme, these measures would cost the exchequer in the short term but could keep local economies afloat, saving more in the long term. Or something even more substantial  a holiday voucher scheme where the government pays, say, 30% per cent, towards the cost of a trip in the UK, whether thats a weekend in a caravan in Blackpool or 10 days in a luxury eco-home in the Cotswolds.  Its likely this government will fall back on the same regressive measures that Conservatives have traditionally used . But its now clear that, without careful handling, the looming economic collapse in parts of the north will totally overshadow the 2008 crash and its aftermath.

"2020-05-01T11:46:44Z","politics","Politics","Boris Johnson is back. But has he changed?","It was a low-key comeback. After a week in hospital, and two more spent recuperating at Chequers, the prime ministers official country residence, Boris Johnson arrived at Downing Street last weekend in an inconspicuous Volkswagen mini-van. He slipped inside. There was no victory sign or cheerful wave. For an unprecedented period, the prime minister had been missing. He was either laid low from his coronavirus symptoms, in intensive care in St Thomas hospital in Westminster, or recovering from what the tabloids called his brush with death. It was clear that few major government decisions had been made in Johnsons long absence. Now, according to aides, he was raring to go; he was ready to take control of government affairs and to bounce back. The country, not to mention deferential cabinet colleagues, were waiting for some answers. Was Johnson in favour of easing lockdown? When and how might this happen? And were his laissez-faire instincts a thing of the past? There were personal questions, too. Namely, whether Johnsons experience of grave illness had recast his personality for the better. In the pre-virus days, the serious politician played second fiddle to the crowd-pleasing comedian and columnist. Now, some saw Johnson taking on a new persona befitting our pandemic-shaped age: that of a statesman. On Monday, for instance, the Times reported an unnamed cabinet minister saying his illness has changed him  He now has an emotional connection to the NHS that you dont get from anything except a near-death experience. The early signals, though, were mixed. At 9am on Monday morning Johnson appeared in front of Downing Street. His five-minute speech showed a man labouring to breathe as he spoke. His clothes seemed to hang off him  his appearance and demeanour a physical embodiment of the effects of the infection.    Boris Johnson arriving back at Downing Street from hospital after the birth of his baby son. Photograph: Andrew Parsons/AP   He gave no hint as to when schools and non-essential shops might reopen and some measure of normal life resume. Nor was there acknowledgement  tacit or otherwise  that his time away had clarified his thinking, or made him inclined to choose this moment to level with the country, as he has previously promised to do, about the decisions that have been taken, the potential mistakes that have been made over the timing of the lockdown. He swerved around the questions about the lockdown, the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the chaos over testing.  Instead, Johnson asked the nation for patience. I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of the conflict, he said. There seemed to be deliberate echoes here of Churchills famous second world war speech about the end of the beginning. Johnson offered further flourishes. The disease  as he himself knew  was an invisible mugger. Thanks to our collective efforts, Britain had wrestled it to the ground.   Related: The Guardian view on Johnson's Covid-19 plan: doubt, deny and dismiss | Editorial   The phrase didnt really capture the grim and multitudinous truth. By Monday more than 20,000 people had officially died of the virus  in hospitals, care centres, or in quiet agony at home, surrounded by loved ones. They were not so much mugged as extinguished before their time. By the end of the week the official tally was 27,000-plus, and probably much higher. To his critics, who have included normally loyal supporters in the rightwing media, there are still searching questions about the prime ministers decisions in late February and March  or lack of them. By some analyses, the UK is on track to have the highest death rate in Europe. Other countries, led by Germany and Denmark, have done much better. Were they less complacent and more organised? Either way, they are now emerging from lockdown. Another moment for Johnson to address these issues might have been prime ministers questions on Wednesday. He was due for the first time to face up to Sir Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader. But the evening before, Downing Street wouldnt say whether Johnson planned to turn up, which was odd.There was speculation Johnson might still be somewhat unwell. In fact, something else was going on. On Wednesday morning, Johnson was at his partner Carrie Symonds side as she gave birth to a baby boy at an NHS hospital. It was the latest dramatic event in what had been an extraordinary period for Johnson, several lives squashed into one almost: Brexit, Covid-19, and the unparalleled shut-down of national life. A photo taken on the stairs of Downing Street showed a grinning Johnson, back from his fiancees bedside. He looks elated and nobody could begrudge the couple their happiness. Well-wishers noted babies change people for the better; cynics pointed out that Johnson has been a father five  or more  times before, and that this arrival might prove a distraction from the tasks ahead. In the nine months since he became PM, Johnson has frequently seemed semi-engaged. Over New Year he had a holiday in the Caribbean. In February he spent 12 days at Chevening, the governments estate in Kent, missing five Cobra meetings as Covid-19 spread from China. Reportedly he took weekends off. Former colleagues have joked Johnson prefers to do many things badly, rather than one thing well  more of a chairman than a CEO. Downing Street aides say this is wrong. They insist Johnson is devoting his full attention to the coronavirus crisis. One ministerial adviser said he was busier at the end of his time off than was admitted. He asked for submissions on a whole range of issues, not just Covid-19. His time in hospital reignited his desire to take care of the NHS, and to get back to work, the adviser said.    Boris Johnson chairs his first digital cabinet meeting at No 10, on 30 April. Photograph: Andrew Parsons/AP   Johnson is now determined to turn the tide on the virus by mid-June, officials suggest. In his absence ministers have argued about the right way forward. Johnson is keen to take back control of the political situation, officials stress, and is reportedly annoyed at leaks suggesting the cabinet is split between pro-economy hawks and cautious lockdown doves. So what next? Before falling sick, Johnson could be counted among those who were bullish about the prospect of easing restrictions and returning to business as usual relatively quickly. Multiple sources with knowledge of his thinking say some of that optimism has faded. They says this partly reflects his own experiences in intensive care  but also the changing scientific picture presented to him. There has been briefing from some close to No 10 against Matt [Hancock]. But the truth is the PMs position is much closer to Matts than those pushing for measures to be lifted. Dom [Raab] has come round to that view as well, one cabinet source said.   Related: The language that disguises the governments failings on coronavirus | Letters   It was Johnson, apparently, who approved the decision to add care home figures to the daily death tally  a risky move towards transparency, given the horrifying numbers involved. And then on Thursday the prime minister appeared for the first time in well over a month at the governments 5pm press conference. Again, he was breathless. And more hesitant than usual, misreading the figure for deaths. And again, he chose not to address the questions that have been asked of him personally, or his government. So far, neither he, nor anybody in his top team, has wanted to meet the challenge set them by Intisar Chowdhury, the 18-year-old son of an NHS doctor who died with coronavirus. The teenager has asked for an apology, for ministers to openly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling this virus. At the daily briefing, Johnson stressed the allegedly good news. The UK had passed the peak of the disease. It was was on a downward slope. He promised details next week of how lockdown might end. There would be a roadmap and a menu of options. There was a warning, too. Johnson likened the pandemic to a pleasant European motoring holiday that had got into unexpected difficulty. Britain was driving through a huge Alpine tunnel. Ahead were sunlight and pasture. It needed to keep control, lest it run into a second and bigger mountain.  He claimed the UK had avoided the tragedy that had engulfed other places. Asked if his time in hospital had altered him, he said he was very, very lucky and paid tribute to the thousands of people who had been less fortunate. For the moment, Johnsons political opponents recognise he is unassailable. His popularity ratings are high. The country, polls suggest, is inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now, while the virus is still a threat and the NHS is under great strain.   Related: Lack of logic in Boris Johnsons claims on lockdown and coronavirus peak | Letters   The new baby will generate further goodwill. There have been gushing headlines from the pro-Boris ringwing media, with more to come when the boy is named, and the first pictures emerge. It is the perfect plotline in a time of gloom. But Johnson will not be able to put off a reckoning forever. The governments chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said as much on Thursday when he suggested the country needed to focus on the crisis in hand, and not dwell  for now  on how we got here. Other leaders have emerged from the crisis with their reputations enhanced  Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, Angela Merkel in Germany, Andrew Cuomo in New York. But they followed a different template: level with the public, admit mistakes, explain the facts. Will Johnson do likewise? There were few indications last week that Johnson is inclined to do so.  So far, at least, the new Boris looks remarkably like the old one.","1570"

The pair finished 2-2 in 15-minute rapid but Nakamura won 2-0 in five-minute blitz. Scores in the group phase were Nakamura (US) and Ding (China) 15 match points, Carlsen (Norway) and Caruana (US) 13, Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia) 8, Alireza Firouzja (ex-Iran) and Anish Giri (Netherlands) 7, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) 6 (13.5). Carlsen won his first four matches impressively, but then, with his semi-final qualification almost assured, he became too careless, relaxed or erratic and suffered reverses using offbeat openings. His first black game against Ding began with a dubious Scandinavian Defence 1 e4 Nc6 2 Nf3 d5 3 exd5 Qxd5, and his second with the outlandish 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 h5?! Playing White, Carlsen lost with the Kings Gambit 1 e4 e5 2 f4. His worst opening disaster came against Nepomniachtchi, Russias world No 4, which began 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Bc4?! Nxe4 6 Qh5 e6. Here White should play 7 Bb5+, but after several minutes thought Carlsen chose 7 Nxe6?? Bxe6 8 Bxe6 Qe7! when Black wins a piece and the game, although White continued for another 20 moves before resigning. I just completely blanked and couldnt remember what to do, said Carlsen. The same unsound sacrifice at e6 occurred 56 years ago during Bobby Fischers 1964 US simultaneous tour. Fischer was Black and instantly found the refutation. Dings performance was sharp, confident, and completely recovered from his disastrous over-the-board Candidates where his play suffered from enforced quarantines at home and in Russia. He won in 16 moves against the Frenchman who led the Candidates when it was abandoned. Ding could be the favourite Saturday, but Carlsen said: Now its dead serious. From now on you will see me from a completely different side. Just two days after the Carlsen Invitational ends, the global chess body, Fide, launches the Nations Cup with teams from China, United States, Europe, Russia, India and the Rest of the World. China are the favourites, fielding their top four men plus Hou Yifan and Ju Wenjun for the womens board. While Carlsens tournament has been played on chess24, which he partly owns, the Nations Cup will be on chess.com, which was already a partner in the 2019 Isle of Man world championship qualifier. Their website rivalry is set to intensify, as neither publicises the others tournaments. A third major site, lichess.org, which is user-friendly and the best for newcomers to internet chess, hosted Carlsens marathon bullet match against Firouzja and is the venue for Britains online 4NCL league, now in its fourth week and where matches can be viewed every Tuesday evening. Carlsens absence from the Nations Cup could mark the beginning of a fundamental split. A few years ago he stated that the world championship needed a new format, much like what has been on show on chess24 this week, and he has also conspicuously failed to confirm that he will defend his global crown in Dubai in December 2021, which is Fides current plan.   Related: Garry Kasparov to take part in online Nations Cup chess tournament   For its first 60 years the world champion decided his own challenger, and some worthy candidates were rejected because they could not raise funds while lesser lights were sometimes accepted because they had backers. There was another hiatus from 1993 to 2005 when Garry Kasparov broke with Fide and there were two rival claimants. It could have happened in 1975, too, if the Bobby Fischer-Anatoly Karpov negotiations had been successful. Now, as in the era of Emanuel Lasker, Jos Capablanca, and Kasparov, there is a dominant champion, while due to Covid-19 the official world body has been forced to substantially curtail its programme. In particular the Candidates tournament to decide Carlsens challenger was stopped at halfway and remains in limbo with resumption unlikely before 2021. Could Carlsen try to fill this vacuum with his own online world championship series? 3669: 1...Bxe4 2 Qxe4 Qxe4 3 Rxe4 Rxh4! when if 4 Rxh4 Bxf2+ with Bxh4 and the extra bishop wins.","774"

Contact tracing in the region is expected to resume next week but may face challenges if the virus, as is probable, continues to threaten communities beyond the 31 December deadline for a Brexit trade deal, local politicians have said.

 Related: Concerns raised as Covid-19 cases surge along Irish border 

The tracing of number plates, flight passenger lists and coronavirus test results could become impossible unless the UK agrees a deal on its future relationship with the EU that includes security and data-sharing arrangements.
What detail, what level of information we share [in 2021] has still to be worked out, said Robin Swann, Stormonts health minister.



   default
  


Data shared between authorities in Belfast and Dublin helped in February to trace passengers on a plane that landed in Dublin airport who may have had contact with a resident who went on to Northern Ireland and later tested positive for coronavirus.
The Social Democrat and Labour party assembly member Matthew OTooleasked Swann if this would continue beyond December in the absence of a trade deal or extension to the transition period.
We will probably still be contact tracing people, we will still be moving from Dundalk to Newry and Buncrana to Derry, said OToole in reference to border towns. Is there a risk that if we leave the transition period without a deal and there is legal uncertainty around our information governance framework that would put contact tracing particularly in border areas into risk?
Swann replied that it had been flagged as an issue under Brexits Operation Yellowhammer contingency planning but that no action could be taken until they knew what shape Brexit would take.
This is new to this island, this is new to the UK, this is new to Europe and we look at how we actually start to do this level of contact tracing so when it comes to legalities, who holds the information? Is it held on your phone, is it held in a central database? That all has to be [worked out] at this point of time, he told the Stormont assembly.



Lets get it up and running and we will work round the rest of it when we get to the end of the year and we see where we are in regards to Brexit.
Swanns comments come as the European commission told the UK that time was short to implement the Northern Ireland protocol that Boris Johnson included in the withdrawal agreement in January.
A technical note issued by Brussels put flesh on the bones of the protocol and served as a reminder of the scale of the challenge facing businesses and now health authorities in the face of a national health emergency.

"2020-05-01T11:31:42Z","commentisfree","Opinion","Why is Trump insisting that meat-packing plants stay open despite risks?","Thousands of workers stream in single file, at dawn and mid-afternoon, to suit up in masks and chain gloves and put their lives on the line so you can put cheap sausage on your biscuit. They are accustomed to living in fear  of starvation from drought in Guatemala, or death squads in El Salvador or drug cartels in Mexico. Of being hunted and caged, whether documented or not. And now, of meeting their fate over a pork chop.   Related: Trump is marching meatpacking workers off to their deaths | Steven Greenhouse   Its genocide against the working class. Its hard to visualize it and articulate it for what it is, Jesse Case, the leader of Teamsters Local 238, the largest private-sector union in Iowa, told me. Donald Trump, invoking the Defense Production Act, has ordered meatpacking plants to stay open no matter the cost. Plants wont even close for a deep cleaning when a deadly pathogen is found. The president said he is protecting companies from liability  you know, in case somebody keels over because of someone elses negligence. Across America, packing plants for beef, pork, chicken and turkey have been closing as workers fall ill with Covid-19 or die. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has said that at least 72 of its members have died from coronavirus, and thousands more may be infected; because of the lack of tests, no one knows the true number. Despite repeated warnings in the presidential briefing books months ago, nobody instructed industry to gear up or how. In Storm Lake, Iowa, center of the densest livestock-producing region in America, none of the roughly 2,500 pork and turkey processing workers at Tyson Foods plants have been tested for the coronavirus. Hence, Buena Vista county reports only four cases so far, while nearby red meat hub Sioux City is the hottest spot in the USA. Workers temperatures are checked. If they feel sick they are advised to stay home. They are told to space out and not crowd into the locker rooms. Plastic hangs between workers on the line. Tyson says it is doing all it can by staggering breaks and spacing workers. Iowas governor, Kim Reynolds, a Republican, directed testing resources to Tysons Waterloo plant. There, workers are represented by the UFCW. The local sheriff said he wanted a boot slammed down on the slaughterhouse. But in Storm Lake, testing is limited to healthcare and nursing home workers and patients. None for the packinghouse crowd, who are overwhelmingly Latino and non-union. Before the order they did their duty and clocked in. Nobody had to threaten them. They need the check. If you report sick with the virus, you might imagine finding yourself on the next bus to Jurez whether you have papers or not. They want to work  safely. Tyson says that its workers are documented. But Trump and the likes of the Iowa congressman Steve King, the race-baiting Republican, have Latino workers shaking in their boots. The governor warns that if a plant reopens and you dont show up, unemployment benefits cease. And then the president orders that the plants shall reopen come hell or a virus. The leaders of the big meatpackers are warning of spot meat shortages  plant capacity has dropped 40% in recent weeks from worker shortages. You just cant let this Storm Lake plant shut down. But what happens if it explodes? The anxiety cuts to our quick. Remember, too, that Smithfield Foods is owned by a Chinese conglomerate. Prestage Farms, in Eagle Grove, Iowa, has taken to sending whole hog carcasses to China for lack of further processing help amid our cornfields. This is not really an American food shortage. The supply chain is so tight that when two plants go down  Smithfield in Sioux Falls and Tyson in Waterloo  fully 10% of national pork production is knocked out. Everyone has to eat, and they have not yet developed a taste for algae or even tofu. The world eats meat. Shoppers can clear out a grocery display in minutes, and a meat supply in a week. Somebody has to process the hogs and birds that keep coming no matter a virus. Mike Pence called our neighbors heroes. The secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, called them patriots. Trump stopped legal residency permitting for immigrants. Nobody is talking about amnesty or even hearing the refugees. In fact, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told Bloomberg Law nobody is talking about providing undocumented workers healthcare. The state and federal governments did not order slower line speeds or provide protective gear for the packinghouse. Tyson asked for imposed guidance and resources, and got a promise of liability protection from worker claims. But there is this sticky thing called the 10th amendment that does not allow the president to waive corporate liabilities in state courts or workers compensation processes, says Storm Lake attorney Willis Hamilton, who has been advocating for food processing employees for nearly 50 years. The order was about instilling fear, Hamilton said. He says his clients are afraid of sick leave and afraid of filing for workers comp or unemployment. They have to threaten people. These dont even think about it orders fit into a system that marches workers to their deaths, Case said. Fear is turning to anger, and thats when people organize. Or just pray.

Student groups representing the students, from across the UK, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities. Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs. The Indian National Students Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food.  Charan Sekhon, chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: We have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They havent got anything at all to eat. Virendra Sharma, Labour MP for Ealing Southall, wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Wednesday calling for universities to ringfence money from hardship funds, which are often discretionary, for international students. He also called for minimum service standards for universities to ensure they are offering students enough advice and support. He wrote: I have heard stories of international students contemplating suicide because they do not know what to do and cannot afford to eat. India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around 300 were selling for 2,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain.   Related: Loss of international student fees could decimate UK research   India is the fastest growing market for British universities, with nearly 27,000 Indian students coming to the UK in 2018-19. International students can pay up to 38,000 a year in tuition fees to study for an undergraduate degree at a UK university. Indian student groups and charities say many Indian students are not from wealthy families, and have to rely on part-time jobs to cover their living expenses. Sekhon says his small charity, which usually focuses on education projects, has been flooded with queries from students since being listed by the Indian high commission as a coronavirus support group. It has been delivering free hot meals and food to Indian students in Milton Keynes, Bedford and Luton for the past four weeks. He says the students are mainly from the universities of Cranfield, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. I dont think universities fully understand what is going on, he says. Many of these students have been doing cash-in-hand or hourly-paid jobs, which they have lost. They cant get home to their families, and they feel alone and dont know how to access help like food banks. A spokesperson for the University of Bedfordshire says: Students dont always highlight their difficulties and dont contact our support team. We would urge students who are struggling to get in contact straight away. The university can provide care packages and financial support as well as help finding work, she says. Cranfield University says it is aware of only one case of hardship. Our student support and wellbeing team is looking into the details and will offer help, it says. The University of Hertfordshire says is it offering wellbeing support, care packages, accommodation and food vouchers and has set up a new fund to help students in hardship as a result of the pandemic.  Sameer Dhore, a student at the University of Greenwich and president of the universitys Indian Society, says: Students are crying on the phone saying they want to see their mum or dad. The major issue is finance. Students are running out of money right now. There are students with nothing to live on. The National Indian Students and Alumni Union says it has received thousands of queries from anxious students trapped across the UK, hundreds of whom say they do not have enough to eat. Sanam Arora, NISAUs chairwoman, says: A lot of students rely on part-time jobs, and now they have lost them they cant pay their rent or buy food. She says there is an atmosphere of panic: The mental health issues are just flabbergasting. Some students have even threatened suicide. The organisation has called on the Indian government to help get students home, and is backing a call by the UKs National Union of Students for the UK government to do more to help. International students are falling through the safety net, she warns.   Related: Students try to flee UK by chartered plane for safer China   Meanwhile, the Indian National Students Association said it had helped to distribute more than 3,600 rescue packages of groceries and ready meals to students so far. Of these, 90% were in England, although it has also supported students in Wales, Scotland and Belfast. Indian grocery stores and restaurants have been contacting the association offering spare food, and helping to get this to students in need. Prerit Souda, an INSA committee member, says that as well as being unable to buy food, some students have been facing eviction because they cannot pay their rent. We connect them with legal experts, but in some scenarios students have been sub-contracting and that is much more difficult as they dont have the same rights. In those cases we have been working with Indian community organisations to find them somewhere free to stay. The Indian government has said the flights ban will continue until midnight on Sunday. Student groups, charities and parents are calling for students to be put to the front of the queue for repatriation. Universities UK, the vice-chancellors group, says all universities now have support systems in place. Vivienne Stern, UUKs international director, says: The first piece of advice we would give students is please, please contact your university. If they dont know, they cant help you. They might not be able to fix everything, but there are people on hand who want to help and listen to your problems. Stern says some universities are going the extra mile to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to come to them. These include Exeter University, which has been calling all remaining international students daily. Meanwhile, Bath University has moved students who were in halls in the city centre into rooms on its campus, and is providing three free meals a day. Meanwhile, parents and relatives back in India have been using social media to beg the Indian government to bring their children home.  They include Dipti Taluja, whose 18-year-old son is doing a degree in sound engineering and music production at a private higher education institution in London. It is very scary sitting thousands of miles away and knowing you are helpless and cannot do anything to bring back your child, she says from her home in Gurugram, near New Delhi. Her son has been very depressed, she says, but is coping better after speaking to volunteers at NISAU. The UK Council for International Student Affairs has an advice page to help students.","1181"

The owner of the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex said it had collected 40% of the rent due by the end of March, up from 29% collected on the due date, and some tenants were refusing to enter talks to find a solution to unpaid bills.     Intu said: There are a very small number of cases where customers are not currently engaging with us to find a consensual solution  these are large, well-capitalised brands who have the ability to pay but have chosen not to. In these instances we are prepared to take more robust action to enforce the legally binding terms of those leases. The company said it would consider legal action including sending statutory demands, a formal request for payment or winding-up petitions  a legal notice usually sent by a creditor to request that the courts close a company that owes it money  to the one or two tenants who were refusing to pay. The government has banned commercial property landlords from taking legal action against tenants who have not paid their rent until 30 June, to protect retailers and other businesses during the coronavirus crisis. However, the government has asked high-street retailers and other companies to pay what they can to their landlords, and Intu believes a couple of retailers are taking advantage of this situation.  The shopping centre owner is offering monthly rather than quarterly rent payments until the end of the year and has reduced its service charges, and it said it was negotiating rent payment plans with some tenants. The indebted company also used the update to investors to announce it had agreed waivers with some of its lenders to prevent potential breaches as it struggles with plummeting rental income. Intu warned in late March it would breach the terms on its debt commitments after a collapse in retail rents. Colm Lauder, a property analyst at the investment bank Goodbody, said the debt waivers would give Intu some breathing space. While the waivers dont give Intu much flexibility  lasting until June  they only pose weekly battles for the firm rather posing a long-term hurdle. This also signals a good likelihood that other retail landlords will benefit from covenants waivers, he said.  Intu said all of its centres were operating on a semi-closed basis with only essential retailers remaining open. It has furloughed about 60% of its shopping centre staff and 20% at its head office. The company has appointed a chief restructuring officer to help as it works through its strategy to fix the balance sheet. David Hargrave was previously a partner in the restructuring practices of the big-four accountancy firms PwC and EY.   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   Intu has been struggling for some time with its 4.5bn debt pile, and posted a loss of 2bn for 2019. Its share price has fallen by more than 90% over the past 12 months. Even before the coronavirus crisis began, the company had been hit by a spate of retailers closing stores and restructuring, and had been forced to write down the value of its centres by nearly 2bn. The company cancelled its emergency cash call at the start of March because of extreme market conditions as Covid-19 spread around the world. It had aimed to raise at least 1.3bn from investors.","571"

I had just loaded it up and strapped the kids into their seats when my manager called. It was 11 March. The day before, I had completed a tour of Germany, performing 14 concerts in 10 days. The first news about Covid-19 was starting to seep through, but the concert halls were still open and, as a violinist and music director of the Zurich Chamber Orchestra, I had been playing for 2,000 people every night. At the signing sessions afterwards, the promoters had put up large signs requesting that the audience keep their distance and refrain from selfies (which they didnt). Next up, I was due to perform at a festival on the beautiful island of Rgen in the Baltic Sea. Artists were flying in from all around the world, and I had decided to take the family along. Everything was looking fine, when suddenly the bubble burst. As my manager was calling to explain, local authorities on Rgen had announced that all events were to be cancelled with immediate effect. And then began the series of knock-on legislation and further cancellations. Soon I  like musicians around the world  was staring down the barrel of a destitute season.    Singers Joy Denalane & Max Herre, guests on Hope@Home Photograph: ARTE.TV   My kids were probably more upset than I was, at least initially. What about the beach, Dad? You mean we cant swim in the sea? A week later I was starting to grow a beard and my wife was seriously wondering when Id go back on the road and stop driving her round the bend. We binged on Netflix and Ben & Jerrys: my beautiful boys goggled at me with a mixture of love and increasing bewilderment as I read to them every night. When is Dad leaving again? they wondered  I am constantly on the road and they are used to my frequent long absences. Online, I saw my esteemed colleagues performing from their gardens, their balconies, their kitchens. At first I was hooked. What a wonderful idea: the dissemination of music at a ghastly time in our troubled world. But I started to wonder about the sound quality. Of course, a cell phone is a cell phone. But isnt classical music all about sound, about really listening? All my Russian fiddle teachers certainly thought so: make a beautiful sound and youll be OK, they told me when I was a boy. Was it possible to produce a stream from home that would sound like it was in a concert hall?    Nice to finally meet you ... guests Simon Rattle and Magdalena Kozena. Photograph: ARTE.TV   The next morning, I called Tobias Lehmann, a giant in the world of sound engineering who co-owns Berlins Teldex Studios. An hour later he was standing in my living room, taking measurements. I think we can make it work, he chirped. Next I called Wolfgang Bergmann, the head of the German section of Arte, a magnificent Franco-German television channel that lives and breathes culture as a public broadcaster. He and I had discussed many broadcasting ideas in the past. Would I be interested in a livestream? he asked. Only if it is with top-notch sound, I replied. Can you start tomorrow? he asked. I told him he was mad, and he said yes, but that I was even madder. He sent over two creative directors who within hours built a set in my living room, brought in beautiful art nouveau lighting to match the existing decor, and worked out how to turn our idea into reality. At this point we were still allowed to move freely and the production company still had permission to film, so long as we all kept at least 1.5m apart.   I could never have imagined in my wildest dreams that such an eclectic bevy of artists would pass through my Berlin salon   We set up two unmanned cameras in addition to the cameraman in the room, thereby limiting how many people were actually in the space at a given time. Fortunately my living room is a fairly large open space which has separate rooms connecting to it. All the editing was done remotely, and the sound team we put in the basement. With a little remote instruction I was able to move the microphones around myself. I call it DIY television. What I needed next was a brilliant pianist who was also an arranger and at the same time able to improvise. Christoph Israel, whom Ive known for years, fitted the bill perfectly. He had just written the music for an Agatha Christie production, which had also been cancelled, so he was sitting at home like everyone else, staring at the ceiling. I assembled an enormous list of pieces, he added more, and we spent three hours playing it all through. I dont think any of us imagined just how much repertoire we would be going through night after night, with barely any rehearsal time.    Jazz trumpeter Till Bronner, a guest on Hope@Home. Photograph: ARTE.TV   What about some guests? Wolfgang inquired casually after the first episode. Luckily I live in one of the worlds most musical cities. I started to call people up. They all said the same: Nothing in the diary, of course well come. Pick a day. Simon Rattle skipped merrily up my front steps: Nice to finally meet you, AND play with you. Robert Wilson was in lockdown around the corner. May I write some text for you  you play and Ill talk? he offered. Director Barrie Kosky popped over to read Joseph Roth, Vladimir Jurowski and I played Schnittke, and Matthias Goerne sang Brahms. I paired Korngolds music with Stefan Zweig and Manuel de Fallas with Rudyard Kipling, and played jazz with Gwilym Simcock on world jazz day. There was no script nor a producer telling me what to say or play. We just went straight in and improvised and learned as we went along. In an early show I did a live Zoom call to one of the citys leading paediatricians  I was both concerned and interested to learn how children could be affected by the virus. But as fascinating as it was, we soon realised that people wanted less reality, so instead I asked people to send in videos of their own homemade music-making. Weve had literally hundreds to date, and I try and show one every night.   Until now, I had spent the majority of my time on the road to communicate with my audience, while using the internet to stay in touch with my family. Now the tables have turned   I could never have imagined in my wildest dreams that such an eclectic bevy of artists would pass through my Berlin salon, nor that we would resurrect the age-old art of the house concert. That Hope@Home has attracted nearly 2 million streams is nothing short of a miracle. People are watching from all over the world  Europe, Russia, China, North America, Japan, India, South Africa, Australia, Argentina. Many have offered to make donations to charities helping freelance musicians  I made a feature of this early on and encouraged viewers to help artists affected by the current shutdown. Until now, I had spent the vast majority of my time on the road in order to communicate with my audience, while using the internet to stay in touch with my family. Now the tables have turned: in these six weeks Ive been spending time at home, and in the evening, I merely pop downstairs to share my music with a global audience. As the shutdown continued, Arte extended the show three times. Now, as we approach 34 episodes, five best ofs and a TV special, Ive decided, with a somewhat heavy heart, to close this lockdown chapter. Its been a privilege and a thrill. Ive not felt this artistically free in years, but for now, we need our living room back. So I guess Ill work on that beard, and take my boys to the park.  Hope@Home streams live at 5pm BST/6pm CET on Arte (and via Facebook live) and is available on demand for 90 days after broadcast.

Related: Rugby league gets 16m emergency loan from government   Clubs from across the professional game are expected to apply for much-needed funding, with Rimmer admitting many faced an uncertain future without the governments help. The Guardian understands funding will be distributed based on projected revenue forecasts that were submitted to the RFL before the season began, rather than every club simply receiving the same amount, and Rimmer stressed they will not simply be issuing cash to clubs without good reason. Its certainly not a gravy train; there are conditions attached to this money and well use it wisely to steer ourselves into a better place, Rimmer said. We have to make this last as long as we can. The sport took some drastic measures to cut its cloth when lockdown began, and none of those measured should be backtracked as a result of this. Its not about dropping a lump sum in a clubs bank account and telling them to carry on as normal: we have to be far more meticulous. Rimmer confirmed the sports professional clubs will receive the majority of the money, with the community game instead set to benefit from other initiatives with the likes of Sport England. Overseas clubs such as the Super League sides Catalans and Toronto, however, are not eligible to receive a share.    Ralph Rimmer, the RFL chief executive.

There will be some clubs that will require far more support than others, and we will use the money to get the collective through and use it responsibly. Rimmer admitted dialogue would continue between the government and the RFL in terms of further funding and revealed the sport has started to put modelling in place for a potential resumption of the domestic season, which could include playing multiple games in single venues behind closed doors.Clubs are eyeing a return in either June or July, and Rimmer said: There is the possibility of playing a number of games at one particular venue in terms of how we re-emerge in the first instance.

This cataclysmic data came on the heels of the steepest first-quarter GDP decline since the Great Recession, projections of a second-quarter GDP drop of 40% and an admission by Kevin Hassett, the presidents chief economic adviser, that unemployment could hit 20% by June, a level not experienced since the Great Depression. For a president who claimed to be a champion of the working class, this is an abject failure. The answer to the question of whether you are better off today than you were four years ago would appear to be simple. But it isnt. At the same time as the economy is cratering and coronaviruss death toll has surpassed the number of US troops killed in Vietnam, the stock market has rebounded from its March lows. As a result, its behavior under Trump still surpasses its performances during the Reagan and Bush Sr years. For how much longer is still an open question. On the other hand, as far as Barack Obama and Bill Clinton went, Trump isnt even close. Still its a quantifiable achievement, and those close to the president and his campaign know it. In a conversation with the Guardian, a connected Trump campaign adviser took pride in the markets April advance, expressed displeasure with the word choices of Trumps economic advisers, and remained mute with regard to recent job losses. In Trumps world, its the stock market, stupid. No wonder Jared Kushner boasts that the administration coronavirus response is a great success story, and opines thats really what needs to be told. Can you say, Mission Accomplished 2.0? At the 1984 Democratic convention, Mario Cuomo, the late New York governor and father of Andrew Cuomo, the incumbent, riffed on Charles Dickens and delivered the most memorable keynote speech in recent history. Cuomo told those assembled that the nation was more a Tale of Two Cities than a Shining City on a Hill. To be sure, the speech won accolades but failed to resonate. Walter Mondale, the Democratic nominee, was shellacked on election day. Mondales problem was that by 1984 most of the US came to believe that it was Morning in America. The recovery was real, inflation had been drained from the system. Beyond that, President Reagan had not made the stock market the exclusive barometer of the countrys wellbeing. Rather, the drop in unemployment moved in tandem with the Dows rise. 2020, however, is a very different time and Trump is a very different president. Unemployment America is getting ravaged. The labor departments latest report is also flashing red over key electoral battlegrounds. Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states with the highest insured unemployment rates. At the same time, Florida and Texas are among the states showing largest numbers of initial jobless claims. Not surprisingly, recent polls show Joe Biden with small but persistent leads in Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania To put things into perspective, if those results hold on election day, Biden would be the 46th president and Trump would go down as an impeached one-term president. But now even Texas is in play, which last went Democratic in 1976. Back then, the ticket of Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale prevailed over a Watergate-stained Republican party. Indeed, the latest poll of Texas voters gives Biden a one-point edge. Beyond that, Texass emerging woes may signal problems ahead in the rest of the oil patch. There is a reason that the president reportedly threatened to sue his campaign manager and erupted, Im not fucking losing to Joe Biden  because he possibly will. Trumps Two Americas strategy appears devastating to working Americans and to himself.

If theres a big winner from the coronavirus, then its Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos. On Thursday his online retail corporation announced revenues of $74.5bn in the first quarter of 2020, 26% higher than the same period last year and equivalent to more than $33m an hour.
Meanwhile, hundreds of workers in Amazon warehouses and Amazon-owned Whole Foods supermarkets are staging a sick-out on Friday, in protest at what they say are unsafe working conditions. An Amazon spokesperson said the company objected to the irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation, while Bezos announced plans to plow $4bn into pandemic-related expenses, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and higher wages for workers.

Trump claims theres evidence Covid-19 came from a Wuhan lab







US intelligence agencies say they agree with the scientific consensus that the coronavirus was not manmade or genetically modified. But Donald Trump begs to differ: on Thursday the president implied, without details, that he had seen evidence to support an unproven theory that Covid-19 originated at a virology lab in Wuhan.
Reports suggest the administration is pressurising intelligence officials to turn up proof of the theory, and analysts fear the president is looking for propaganda to prop up his attacks on China for its handling of the pandemic. On Friday, Trump will leave the White House for the first time in a month, to travel to Camp David.

Whistleblower complaint. The governments former vaccine chief, Dr Rick Bright, is preparing a whistleblower complaint after claiming he was dismissed from his role because he resisted political pressure to expand the use of a malaria drug touted by Trump as a potential Covid-19 gamechanger.

A recent doorstep tribute in a Johannesburg suburb to applaud the efforts of essential workers was dubbed an illegal gathering by police summoned to break up the event. A resident remarked that it was an eerie reminder of South Africas past  a throwback to the times of apartheid. The rules keep changing, admitted one officer when it was suggested that the response was heavy-handed. No harm was done but the incident highlights the potential shifts in power dynamics that fear brings, as well as the disconnect between good intentions and how they are implemented. In unprecedented times Covid-19 remains an unknown adversary, with the African continent left to second guess its trajectory. So far it has not matched the terrifying numbers in China, North America and Europe, but it is early days. History shows how power thrives on confusion, and trade-offs between freedoms and security. These need to be constantly recalibrated  and science and politics need to work together. Leaders of 300 African civil society organisations are among 600 globally to have penned an open letter to heads of state urging adherence to the rule of law, warning that all responses should be evidence-based, time-bound and proportionate. In many ways lockdowns echo previous state crackdowns in the wake of terror attacks on the African continent. In Kenya and Uganda, emergency measures in response to violent attacks have amplified excesses of the security services. Covid-19 would appear to be no different; there are reports of killings by security services enforcing lockdowns in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Like the terrorist threats, will the legacy of Covid-19 shape how countries are governed? Although  in a rare break with tradition  Kenyas President Uhuru Kenyatta apologised for overzealous policing, now more than ever the need for tough executive oversight is clear. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa has blended economic pragmatism with compassion, with a 500bn rand (22bn) rescue package to support businesses and the vulnerable. His tough lockdown measures received international praise. Yet Ramaphosas response has arguably been soured by the revelation that 73,000 South African troops  virtually the entire national defence force  are to be deployed until the end of June. Military deployment should be a last resort, not a useful governance tool. Soldiers have been used to help build hospitals, distribute food and provide engineering assistance in countries such as the UK and Spain; in South Africa their role appears to be as enforcer. While the South African National Defence Force has a proud history of peacekeeping across the continent, its troops do not belong in the streets or crowded informal settlements. What would be their response to a rowdy food distribution for instance  restraint or firepower? Monitoring state excesses would traditionally be a job for the media. Journalists in South Africa have been afforded essential worker status, but in recent weeks have found themselves under fire. A camerawoman was shot at by police as she tried to capture footage of the lockdown. In Zimbabwe, a court earlier this month derided the police for using Covid-19 as a pretext for media harassment. Many African countries have demonstrated an admirable ability to leverage tech to assist in the Covid-19 response. Examples include bluetooth platforms used for contact tracing in Nigeria, WhatsApp live chats for providing health information in South Africa, and mobile money solutions for welfare payouts in Kenya and Mauritius. South Africa, with its long tradition of human rights struggles, has stopped short of copying South Koreas introduction of wristbands to track citizens evading lockdown. But in the northern province of Limpopo, the use of drones by the police as a means of social control has almost gone unnoticed. Surveillance by stealth is a threat to be closely watched. While the assumption is that suspensions of our liberty are bonded with a sunset clause, the danger of function creep  where the application of a piece of technology is not as originally intended  is real. Not least in evolving democracies where oversight institutions are weak.   Related: Teargas, beatings and bleach: the most extreme Covid-19 lockdown controls around the world   Not wishing to undermine the clear benefits of emerging tech, function creep poses a risk to citizen rights given the fetishisation of, and uncritical reliance on, technology. Imagine if surveillance deployed to track Covid-19 was applied to migrants, alleged terrorists or the LGBT community, branded as undesirables by Uganda? We need to have a kill switch so that such technologies are not misused after the pandemic. At the very least we need to start the conversation. It is well documented how technologies developed as defensive tools by the military continue to find broader applications  not all sinister. And what of the vast troves of personal data that the monitoring of Covid-19 has collected? Will this have a shelf life? While the right not to be seen is protected in tightened-up data privacy laws, a global pandemic trumps such conventions. While many concede that extreme measures are required in the face of the spectre of mass infection in the poorest parts of Africa, will privacy overrides be reversed when this pandemic has passed?

"2020-05-01T11:01:08Z","uk-news","UK news","Heathrow boss warns of BA-style mass redundancies","Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrance to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission.     Passenger numbers at the UKs largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures. He said while forward bookings implied there was still massive demand for travel, it was vital to plan ahead.  If we dont do that work now, the UK economy will not get back on its feet as quickly as it should. We must have a package of measures that does not involve social distancing  It is impossible for transport, let alone aviation  You need a queue a kilometre long for one plane with 450 people, if you need social distancing  the problem isnt the plane its the airport, he said. We want to make sure that only people with a low risk of infection are travelling. Thats likely to include some form of temperature screening when you come into the airport.    Holland-Kaye said it would become normal for people to wear face masks and more parts of the airport process could be automated to reduce contact between passengers and staff. But he warned that without government planning, to ensure confidence that flying would restart, there would be widespread layoffs.  Heathrow has already made a third of managers, about 500 people, redundant. He said many companies had been holding back on job cuts because of the furlough scheme but aviation need more than that or it will be the last sector out of the crisis. BAs announcement [of 12,000 redundancies] is just the first of many to go down the path  and we may follow.    There was a striking difference between the UK and how most countries had moved to protect airlines and airports, Holland-Kaye said, and although Heathrow  backed by sovereign wealth funds  did not need state support, the sector needed it. He said business rates at Heathrow were now higher than our entire revenue. Meanwhile, he called for any state aid for airlines to be linked to environmental targets. There should be an obligation to get to net-zero as soon as possible and that should apply to aviation, Holland-Kaye said. There should be a commitment to the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and the government should stimulate production of synthetic fuel as a way of helping to reinvigorate the economy.","458"

The premise flatly stated is absurd: the Sixers built a ballclub around a 5ft 11in delinquent from Virginia Beach and it worked. Allen Iverson became the least conventional star ever to lead a team to the NBA finals and the Sixers became the ultimate underdog squad for the ultimate underdog city. From almost the day he arrived in my hometown aged 20, Iverson was plainly one of the NBAs most transcendent talents, whose scoring instinct was amplified by a new-generation, kill-your-idols edge. His was the perfect game for the teenagers we were: reckless, almost violent, crackling with anarchic energy. It quickly became the greatest show in sports and it was happening right in our backyard. AI was just cool as shit. The whole city loved him. He was a singular but flawed talisman: who could win games by himself but refused to lift or do any real treatment, blew off practice because he was hungover, cursed out the coach and all but begged to be kicked off the team. Yet Iversons preposterous feats of bravery  watching him throw his 160lb frame into the paint, carom off the elbows of linebacker-sized defenders, score a bucket and then bounce off the deck to do it again  were his nightly penance and absolution for more than a decade. If clean-cut superstars like Jordan and Kobe strived to embody the (false) ideal of perfection, Iverson unapologetically spoke to the frailties innate in us. He was beloved because he was fallible.    Allen Iverson led the Philadelphia 76ers against all odds against Shaquille ONeal and the talent-stacked Los Angeles Lakers in the 2001 NBA finals. Photograph: Andrew D Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images   No team before or since has ever made a player that little the focal point and understandably so; deep down we knew the blueprint was doomed. But in 2001, it all came together. The concept was simple: the Sixers surrounded Iverson with selfless role players who wouldnt get pissed the smallest guy on the court was chucking up 30 shots a night, their names familiar only because most were on their third or fourth team. The result was Iversons finest season. He became the shortest and lightest player ever to be named MVP, and the Sixers won with a lunch-pail style tailor-made for a town where people care a little bit too much about sports. Even as the injuries mounted during a grueling six-week playoff run  Iversons own list of ailments became almost comical  they kept ripping wins away from opponents in low-possession thrillers where your ass was not touching the seat for 70% of the game. The Sixers were given no chance in the finals against the seemingly invincible Los Angeles Lakers, the in-form defending champions led by Shaq and Kobe who hadnt lost in more than two months. Even at full strength Philadelphia would have had their hands full, but the depleted Mash unit that arrived at the Staples Center for Game 1 of the series was written off entirely. The Lakers immediately showed why, rattling off 16 unanswered points behind the most physically fearsome big man in NBA history at his elemental peak. But after a patchy start Iverson caught fire, slashing and careening to the goal in transition, effortlessly shedding his perimeter defenders out of half-court sets and silencing the Hollywood plastics at courtside. By intermission hed poured in 30, five off Jordans finals record for points in a half, as the Sixers built a lead that would swell to 73-58 in the third quarter.   Allen Iverson delivered one of the one of the great individual performances in NBA finals history against the Lakers in 2001.  After watching Iverson shred Kobe and Derek Fisher for the first half hour, the Lakers looked way down the bench to Tyronn Lue, the seldom-used point guard who had spent the run-up mimicking Iverson against the Lakers first team in practice. Lue harried and hounded Philadelphias star relentlessly, denying him the ball or forcing him into contested jumpers. Whether borne from tactical genius or desperation, it was working. With Iverson in check, Shaq at his unstoppable best and my entire city hanging on every loose ball and rebound, the Lakers chipped away and sent the game to overtime. Then comes the part everyone remembers.   Related: My favourite game: Cubs v Indians, World Series 2016, Game 7   The Sixers are clinging to a two-point lead with about a minute to go when Iverson receives a pass near the corner. He hesitates a half-beat, as if to assess his prey, before crossing over Lue and lofting a stepback jumper that hangs in the air for what seems like ages before ripping through the net, punctuating the coup de grce with an exaggerated high-step over his fallen foil. Forty-eight points, five rebounds, six assists and five steals. Sixers take Game 1, 107-101. It was the apotheosis of the Iverson era and a Whitmanian triumph of the individual, a moment that struck so far beyond sports into the essence of our citys insurgent soul, validating everything Philadelphia embodies and fiercely protected in our Allen: uncompromising, defiant, self-certain to a fault with a taste for the fight. The better team won over the best-of-seven series, as happens in basketball, but Iversons Game 1 masterclass has come to transcend the outcome in NBA history and define his place in the basketball pantheon: the greatest pound for pound to ever do it and a hell of a player.","858"

We are shopping for food less regularly and buying veg in bulk, meaning greens are often not at their freshest by the time I use them. This week, I created two recipes that made use of tired greens; both are inspired by food photographer Joe Woodhouse, who is one of the most inventive vegetable cooks I can think of. All greens pasta (pictured top) This recipe is mainly about the sauce, which can be kept in the fridge or freezer and used for a hit of green with pasta or any grain when fresh reserves are running low. Here Ive put it with some orzo and some buttery fried leeks, but almost any other veg would work. Prep 10 minCook 20 minServes 4 5 tbsp olive oil2 onions, peeled and finely sliced4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced3 tbsp white-wine vinegar500g greens (such as kale, spring greens or cavolo nero), shredded2 leeks (or another green veg of your choice)400g pasta (I used orzo)Hard cheese (such as cheddar, parmesan, pecorino, comte), to finish (optional) Put a frying pan on medium heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil, then the onions, and cook for 10-15 minutes, until soft and sweet. Add the garlic and cook for another three minutes, then add the vinegar and let it evaporate. Next, stir in the greens and leave them to cook for a couple of minutes, so they are wilted but still have their colour (how long this takes will depend on what type of greens you are using  spring greens will take longer than kale, for instance). Put the lot into a blender with the rest of the olive oil, and blitz until you have a thin, green sauce, adding a little water if you need to loosen it. Prepare your other veg: I used leeks, which I cut into 2cm rounds and fried in butter until soft. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water to packet instructions, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water. Put the pasta back into the pan and toss it with about four tablespoons of the green sauce (you might need more or less  trust your judgement), add a little of the cooking water to loosen, and then add the leeks. Serve topped with a good grating of cheese. Peanut butter roasted kale Roasting kale (or any green) until crisp in this peanut-buttery dressing elevates it from a likeable green to a snack that is fought over.

Related: Australia's men rise to top of Test and T20 cricket rankings   Graves, who is now expected to run to become chair of the International Cricket Council when Shashank Manohar departs this summer, had previously extended his five-year term at the ECB by six months in order to oversee the first year of the Hundred. With that tournament now postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, however, the 72-year-old former Yorkshire chairman and Costcutter magnate will pass the baton on to Watmore sooner, subject to ratification by the ECB annual general meeting at the end of this month. The appointment of Watmore as the ECBs first salaried chairman has not been entirely smooth despite a strong CV that includes a background in business as chief executive of Accenture, 16 years as a senior civil servant, a short tenure as chief executive of the Football Association and time on the boards of various sporting bodies.    Ian Watmore was on the board of the EFL for only four months. Photograph: Barrington Coombs/Getty Images for ECB   A report last month in the Daily Mail highlighted a question mark over the 61-year-olds conduct during a four-month stint on the board of the EFL, with the suggestion that a meeting held with Mel Morris, the Derby County owner, had prompted the threat of a breakaway league during a disagreement over a new rights deal. When announcing on Friday that Watmore remains chair-elect, however, an ECB statement said: During an extensive process, that included a confidential review of the report referenced in media, the subcommittee has universally agreed that there was no evidence to support any allegation of wrongdoing on Ian Watmores part. In addition, it was concluded that the appointment process had been undertaken in a thorough and professional manner and the board now regards the matter closed. The ECB review was overseen by the board directors Barry OBrien, Katie Bickerstaffe and Martin Darlow, the first of whom had sat on the original nominations committee chaired by Lucy Pearson and overseen, from a county perspective, by the late David Hodgkiss, the former Lancashire chairman who passed away in March after contracting Covid-19.","371"
"2020-05-01T10:50:33Z","uk-news","UK news","Jeremy Bamber lawyers seek review of CPS refusal to disclose evidence"," Lawyers representing Jeremy Bamber, who is serving a whole life sentence for killing five members of his family in 1985, will ask the high court to review the refusal of the Crown Prosecution Service to disclose evidence they believe could undermine his conviction. They claim the material was made available to an author working on a televised drama about the killings, but not to his defence team. Earlier this year, Carol Ann Lee, the author of the book on which the recent ITV docudrama, White House Farm, was based, said Essex police had assisted her research by providing her with documents from the case. Lee posted an image on Instagram showing a series of numbered documents that have not been disclosed to the defence. She wrote on Instagram: It was interesting to see and read all the original material. The numbered documents taken from Holmes boxes (an administrative system introduced in 1985 to support major investigations) include files numbered 75/13 and 75/15, which Bamber says he has never seen. After Bambers legal team complained to the CPS the Instagram post was deleted. Bamber, aged 59, has spent the past 35 years sifting through millions of documents in an attempt to prove his conviction is unsafe. Because the files in the Holmes boxes are all numbered, he believes certain files have not been disclosed. The hearing on Friday in Leeds follows the refusal by a high court judge to judicially review the decision of the CPS not to disclose material to Bambers defence team. That was a paper hearing in which the judge considered the written evidence in private without representation from Bambers legal team. At Fridays hearing, known as an oral renewal, the case will be fully reconsidered, supported by oral submissions from Bambers legal team.  Bambers adoptive parents Nevill and June Bamber were shot and killed inside their Essex farmhouse during the night of 6-7 August 1985, along with their adopted daughter, Sheila Caffell, and her six-year-old twin boys. Bamber, then 24, had phoned the police to say Nevill had phoned him, saying his sister, Caffell, had gone crazy and has the gun. Initially, police believed that Caffell had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself. But, on 10 August, after the police ended their examination of the crime scene, a relative of Nevill and June Bamber, David Boutflour, found a silencer in the gun cupboard of the farmhouse. It was later said to contain blood belonging to Sheila Caffell. On 7 September 1985, Jeremy Bambers ex-girlfriend told police Bamber had discussed killing his family with her and that he was involved. On 29 September 1985 Bamber was charged with the murders. After the jury was sent out to reach a verdict, it returned and asked the judge for clarification on the silencer and blood evidence. The judge said it contained only the blood of Sheila Caffell. Seventeen minutes later, the jury returned and convicted Bamber by a 10 to two majority. In 2018 the Guardian revealed that a week before the trial, the head of biology at Huntingdon Forensic Science Laboratories wrote to Essex police saying the blood on the silencer could have come from Sheila Caffell or Robert Boutflour, another relative. That letter was not disclosed to the defence. The Guardian also revealed that a peer-reviewed report compiled by Philip Boyce, a ballistics expert at Forensic Equity Ltd, was sent to the CPS in 2019 about the possibility that there had been more than one silencer. The CPS has dismissed his findings, without employing its own expert to study his report. At the trial the prosecution argued that Caffell could not have killed herself because she had been shot in the neck twice. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed statements made by senior police officers who attended the crime scene had been uncovered, stating that they had only seen one bullethole in Caffells neck. Again, these statements were not disclosed to the defence. Bamber believes other vital records have not been disclosed. Mark Newby a solicitor advocate at Quality Solicitors Jordans, which represents Bamber, said: Since proceedings were issued it came to our attention that the author of the book the ITV drama was based upon appears to have received material directly from the police. It cannot be right that an author has been given material that Mr Bambers defence team have not seen, particularly in light of the persistent refusal by the CPS to disclose specific material we have been asking for. It raises the question of whether a work of fiction is more important than justice. Bamber, speaking from Wakefield prison, told the Guardian: It is disgusting that a third party was provided with documents and sensitive photographs when Essex police and the CPS have been unwilling to hand over material to our own forensic experts to prove that two silencers were recovered from the scene. Despite court orders being in place for them to make full disclosure to us, which they deliberately chose to ignore, when Carol Ann Lee requested material she was given it without a second thought. Where is my justice? A spokesperson for Essex police said: We are aware of the claim made by Jeremy Bamber and can confirm that this matter forms part of an ongoing judicial review. As this matter is therefore the subject of a forthcoming legal hearing it would not be appropriate for us to comment further. On 1 May, the case was adjourned to 29 May.  This article was amended on 1 May 2020. The name of the ITV docu-drama was White House Farm, not White House Farm Murders. This has been corrected.","940"

The contemporary artist Howard Silverman, 73, said his part in the development of Spike Island in Bristol had been his lifes work, and being given notice to vacate the studio he considered his spiritual home had devastated him. Fellow studio holders and artists from around the world are backing Silvermans fight to overturn the decision, with some suggesting the organisation is intent on squeezing out older, established tenants in favour of younger ones. The New York-born Silverman, regarded as a cornerstone of the Bristol art scene, said: I wake up in the morning stressed and depressed. It affects family, friends and colleagues. Silverman, whose award-winning work includes installation, sculpture, painting, printmaking, video and digital imagery, is angry that, after spending 46 years at Spike Island and its predecessor organisation, the panel considering his bid to renew his lease had just 20 minutes to study it before debating and then making its decision. He is also distressed that after his appeal was rejected he was served three months notice to vacate during the first days of the Covid-19 lockdown, which would have made packing up and leaving even more difficult. My studio is my spiritual home, he said. It has always been my laboratory and my launch pad. I will be lost without it. Spike Island is the base for more than 70 artists, dozens of creative businesses and hundreds of fine art students. It began in the 1970s as Artspace Bristol, founded by Silverman and a group of other idealistic, radical artists who sought out and administered affordable studio spaces in old industrial buildings. In 1992, the organisation moved to its current home, a former tea-packing warehouse and rebranded as Spike Island. A trust was set up and last year introduced a system of lease reviews. Half of the six artists who have so far reapplied for their leases have been told they must leave.   Related: Historic England launches lockdown photography project   The Spike Island artist Julian Claxton said the decision to evict Silverman was outrageous. He said Silverman remained a cutting edge artist but always had time to encourage and help others. Another artist said he was the life and soul of the community, while a third said it was a mystery why he was being evicted. Within 48 hours, more than 500 people including artists from all around the world had signed a petition protesting against the eviction. A spokesman for Spike Island refused to speak about an individual case, but denied it was favouring younger artists. He said: The studio review process is a way to ensure that our artists studios are managed fairly. Our [studios] must be inclusive and accessible to all in order to support local artists from different backgrounds and at different career stages. The Guardian has seen a letter dated 26 March  after the coronavirus lockdown  from Spike Island giving Silverman three months to leave from that day  which would have involved planning the move during physical distancing. After he objected, Spike Island said the three months notice would begin after lockdown was lifted. The spokesman said Spike Island was being incredibly flexible with artists who were being told to leave. He confirmed the review panel members were given 20 minutes to read submissions from tenants, adding: An extensive period of discussion then follows.","580"

The play-off semi-finals would see Fulham face Preston and Brentford take on Nottingham Forest and could be played as one-off ties at neutral venues behind closed doors, rather than the usual two-legged affairs.   Related: Scott Davies: how gambling led Brendan Rodgers' protege to despair | Ben Fisher   The Championship occupies a middle position between the Premier League, which is confident of finding the ways and means to finish the season, and League One and League Two, whose best efforts may not be enough. There are growing fears for the bottom two divisions because  with no widespread broadcast market for their games  playing behind closed doors would be a massive drain on finances. The Championship wants and intends to complete the season but as its clubs wait to be informed on how protocols for behind-closed-doors matches would work  and how difficult they could be to fulfil  it has been prudent to discuss contingencies that could offer some integrity to the final table. With the caveat that government and public health advice could yet override everything, the working theory is that if the Premier League could potentially play numerous matches, the Championship ought to be able to stage at least three to resolve its play-offs. It is unclear how it would work out the issue of relegation. What the Championship is banking on in terms of promotion is that the Premier League is able to finish and, in doing so, resolve its relegation spots. If it could not, with the standings so tight  four points separate 15th-placed Brighton from 19th-placed Aston Villa, with Villa having a game in hand  it would be extremely difficult to determine which clubs drop down on sporting merit. That unhappy scenario could open up a raft of legal challenges, either from relegated Premier League clubs or those from the Championship denied promotion.   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.  There would be the option of freezing relegation from the Premier League and allowing promotion from the Championship but an enlarged top-flight would bring its own problems. The leading Premier League clubs would rather, in an ideal world, shrink the division to 18 clubs. Bradford, meanwhile, have said it is increasingly likely no fans will be allowed at matches until next year. They said this was discussed in Thursdays meeting involving the EFL and League Two clubs. City officials have recently been informed of the ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021, the club said in a statement. And it is now highly likely that next season will commence behind closed doors. This comes following a meeting yesterday.","462"
"2020-05-01T10:40:24Z","world","World news","For the chop: 'dining table revolution' takes aim at food sharing in China","On 18 January, about 40,000 families in the neighbourhood of Baibuting in Wuhan gathered for a massive potluck meal before the lunary new year. Photographs of the event, proudly published in local state media, showed residents in festive red and yellow bibs digging in, reaching with their chopsticks for hundreds of dishes laid out on banquet tables. Five days later, the city was placed under lockdown and within weeks, there were several possible coronavirus infections in the neighbourhood. For months to come that banquet would be cited as an example of how little local officials had done to prevent the virus from spreading across their city. In the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese authorities are pushing for a dining table revolution to change long-held traditions of communal eating like those on display at the Baibuting meal, where diners take from shared plates with their own chopsticks. Authorities have launched an aggressive campaign to convince diners to use designated serving utensils known as gongkuai or gongshao, or public chopsticks and public spoon. Officials are also encouraging the serving of separate portions rather than family style, where a group shares several dishes.   Related: Will coronavirus spell an end to the great Chinese buffet?   It will be a difficult feat to pull off. After the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, a similar initiative petered out. More challenging is that sharing food is a key part of Chinese social life and a sign of intimacy. The gongkuai  more common in Japan, Korea or Taiwan  tend to be seen at higher-end restaurants in China and rarely used at home. Among family or friends, asking for the serving utensils can be awkward or perceived as rude. The obstacle is the traditional notion that we have to drink together and eat together and not show any distance, said Q Edward Wang, the author of Chopsticks: A Cultural and Culinary History. That kind of notion is well-entrenched in Chinese society as well as around the world, he said. Under chopstick etiquette, taught at an early age, one should touch only the food one intends to eat. But Chinese health officials say the practice leaves too much opportunity for germs to be passed through saliva from ones own set of utensils to the shared dishes.  China coronavirus graphic    Authorities believe sharing meals was one way the virus was passed on in China, especially among families that accounted for 85% of infection clusters in Guangdong and Sichuan province, according to the World Health Organization. Across the country, celebrities, business tycoons, public health experts, and teams of propaganda workers have been deployed to educate the public. Divide meals, not love, state media have declared. In Ningxia in north-west China, a video tutorial by local state media tells residents in local dialect of a new trend in civilised dining. Dividing meals and chopsticks is not dividing love, it assures viewers. In Hangzhou, a local party member has called for 11 November to be designated Peoples Chopsticks Action Day, given the dates similarity to two sets of chopsticks. In Beijing, billboards call for citizens to join the campaign under the tagline: Love is one more pair of chopsticks. Starting in June, restaurants will be required to provide serving utensils and when possible to offer separate portions. The campaign appears to be working at restaurants. A manager at the Tianzhu chopstick factory in Zhejiang province told the Guardian the company has seen orders for gongkuai, which are longer and decorated differently, go up as much as 30%. At Huajia Yiyuan, a chain known for its Beijing roast duck, each place setting has two pairs of chopsticks and two spoons. At a popular hotpot restaurant on Beijings Ghost Street, all tables come with a set of the serving utensils. Customers are very willing to use them, said Lan Luoshi, 20, who works there. If I go out with friends to eat or for hotpot, I will definitely use gongkuai, she said. Changing habits at home and among the older generation may be harder. A common scene at family dinners involves relatives using their own chopsticks to put food on the plates of younger members of the family. Younger family members serve food to their older relatives as a sign of respect, while couples get food for each other in a show of affection. Many do not regard using the designated serving utensils as necessary at home. In a recent online poll by Sina Shanghai, half of more than 650 respondents said they would not use gongkuai or gongshao at home, agreeing with the response: I wont. We are all one family. Chinese eating culture may be changing in other ways, away from crowded, bustling restaurants to quieter affairs. Many restaurants limit the size of dining parties to two and place tables at least 1 metre apart. Shi, 50, a chef at a noodle shop in a mall in Beijings Chaoyang district says he and his wife now rarely invite friends over. He recently noticed a group of co-workers come into his restaurant and naturally split into smaller groups, eating at separate tables. The epidemic has already changed big things, he said. During lunar new year in late January, authorities called on residents not to visit families, a key tradition for the holiday. If the outbreak can change that, changing how we use chopsticks is nothing, he said. According to Wang, it took hundreds of years for chopsticks to become the staple utensil. Changing modern eating habits, while difficult, should not take as long. Customs are much more powerful than policy, he said.    The pandemic and the government directives will provide some impetus. Gradually people will become more adjusted to the idea that even if we dont share food, we are still friends. Additional reporting by Lillian Yang","947"

By dusk on Thursday, all of Tripolis ransacked branches were encased in armour, shielding piles of smouldering ash and rubble, but coming far too late to protect what had been inside. Over two earlier, violent nights, rioters had looted what they could. Six months after a revolution demanding action from a corrupt ruling class, and with a global pandemic now thrown in, its people are returning to the streets in rage at an enfeebled state that has largely left them to fend for themselves as the middle class sinks into poverty. Tripoli, a hub of a nationwide peaceful uprising last October that electrified the country, is now at the centre of something more raw and desperate  an increasing struggle to survive.    Workers install barriers on the facade of a bank in Tripoli. Photograph: Wael Hamzeh/EPA   The extent of the economic predicament has been laid bare in unusually transparent financial statements that have cast new light on Lebanons political structures and left many pondering the viability of a state that has withstood decades of war, occupation and chaos, but now appears adrift. We have been executing something like this for 20 years, but not as bad as what were living, said Fida Jundi Hajjeh, the manager of a Tripoli-based NGO, Sanabel Nour, which provides food and other aid to orphans and the impoverished. The middle class has been demolished. In Tripoli, were all from the low socio-economic classes these days. As much as we can give is not enough, she said as small crowds waited silently outside her office for food coupons. The needs are so great that we sometimes feel we are not doing anything. There are so many employees who have stopped working. Tripoli during daylight hours in Ramadan is usually subdued, but with the coronavirus closing shops and cafes and most arms of government shut down, its streets are sullen and still. That changes as night draws near, bringing with it the bustle of a normal day. There is no social distancin, and very few face masks to shield people from the virus.  Interactive  You think we care about that when people cant feed themselves? asked Linda Borghol, as she stirred a large vat in a makeshift food kitchen. Nobody has anything in Tripoli. Nobody can send money. Even if you can send, its not easy to collect it. People are literally starving. Her NGO provides up to 5,000 people each day with basic sustenance, just as she has since the start of the October revolution. It was easier then, she says, as food was readily sourced, as were donations. But in the last month, the Lebanese currency  pegged to the US dollar since the end of the civil war 30 years ago  has collapsed. On Friday, it was trading at 4,000 lira to $1, after drifting steadily from its official rate of 1,500 lira. An economic package announced by the prime minister, Hassan Diab, on Thursday night fixed a new rate of 3,500 lira for the next 18 months, a move that would formalise at least a 50% price hike for nearly all goods and services, and set in stone prices that many Lebanese have no means to afford. Lebanon is a consumption economy that imports nearly everything and does not produce enough basic food supplies to sustain its population. The increased cost of imports has been quickly passed on. A freeze on many salaries, controls on bank withdrawals and slashed spending on social services, have also ravaged household incomes. The Lebanese government estimates that 75% of the population are now in need of aid, including food aid. Among refugee communities, the need for food aid rises to 90%, according to the International Rescue Committee. Lebanon never had a productive economic model, said Albert Leteyf, a partner at one of the countrys leading financial consultancies, Levantine Partners. Its exports were its people, who sent money to their families. But that was never enough to fill the gap in the trade imbalance. The [dollar] peg gave the Lebanese a sense of artificial wealth. It gave them buying power that did not correspond to the wealth of the country. A belief has taken hold in Tripoli that the countrys political system has entrenched a permanent underclass You think this government cares about us? asked Borhol, waving her ladle. We have to keep going. There needs to be change, or else what will all the people do, leave the country? Then the corrupt politicians will have nothing to rule. When we go to the streets as revolutionaries, we carry stones like Palestinians. Thats all we have. The people are literally starving, and the government is failing them. From his residence in the city, the former justice minister Ashraf Rifi said global politics remained a significant factor in the countrys current crisis.    There is a push me pull me game between the ones who stand with the Americans, and those who stand with the Iranians, he said. When the revolution began, people were not talking in sectarian terms, they were just stating what they wanted. Now they are talking about their demands and the politics as one, because you cannot have one without the other. Rifi, a staunch foe of the most powerful political bloc in the country, the Iran-backed Hezbollah, said the partys role in Lebanon had become insurmountable to those demanding a new form of governance. To do something about it needs to be an international and regional decision. Only then can we meaningfully start to talk about change, he said. There has been a vacuum here for so long now. And when there is a vacant space, polluted matter will take it. Additional reporting by Nadia al-Faour","966"

All of the devices in a consignment of 250 ventilators that arrived from China on 4 April posed such serious problems that they could not be used and were ditched. Doctors in NHS hospitals in the West Midlands, among which the ventilators were shared, were so concerned that they wrote to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, warning that they could kill patients. We believe that if used, significant patient harm, including death, is likely, they wrote in a letter, which was obtained by NBC News. We look forward to the withdrawal and replacement of these ventilators with devices better able to provide intensive care ventilation for our patients. The medics warned the Department of Health and Social Care that the oxygen supply in the devices was variable and unreliable, their build quality was basic, the oxygen connection base was marked as non-EU and their fabric case made them hard to clean. The machines were Shangrila 510 ventilators made by Beijing Aeonmed, a major manufacturer of ventilators in China. They were designed for use in ambulances not hospitals, the doctors said. The day they arrived, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who is helping to co-ordinate the governments response to the pandemic, thanked China for sending them. Weve been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad, including Germany and Switzerland, and today 300 new ventilators arrived from China. Id like to thank the Chinese government, he said at the governments daily news conference, in comments that were widely reported. However, hospitals that then received the devices could not get them to work, despite technical staff spending several days trying to do so. A senior official at one of the hospitals involved said: All of the ventilators failed. Nothing worked. They didnt have proper oxygen centres and the tubing didnt fit. We were irate. All the hospitals tried to get them to work but we couldnt. At the time we were really worried, because we feared that hospitals were going to be overwhelmed with patients with Covid-19 needing to be ventilated. Happily, as it turned out we didnt get quite as many as originally expected so we didnt need the Chinese ventilators after all, which is just as well. The ventilators were part of a government drive to increase the NHSs supply of ventilators from the 8,000 it had before the virus struck, to 30,000, so that anyone needing one during the expected peak of the pandemic could have one while in intensive care. However, that target has since been reduced as hospitals have been able to manage the number of people with Covid-19 needing their care.   Related: We made right choice in ventilator race, says UK consortium head   A well-placed NHS source said the incident highlighted problems that had occurred with a range of medical supplies and equipment ordered from China during the coronavirus pandemic.    Some other stuff ordered from China recently, especially personal protective equipment, has also turned out to be either of a lesser quality than what we need or to be the wrong thing altogether, like T-shirts instead of long-sleeved surgical gowns, they said. You have to be careful who you procure stuff from, because the supply and then what ultimately arrives can be very variable. But, then again, we didnt have enough ventilators to start with because the government was unprepared for coronavirus, so we had to ask China to help. NBC News reported that it approached the international sales manager for Beijing Aeonmed, who said: I dont know, when asked whether the company was aware of the concerns about its product, before the call ended. A government spokesperson said: The Shangrila 510 ventilator model is not being used in hospitals and no patients are at risk. Ventilators need to pass robust regulatory tests to ensure they are up to standard before theyre delivered to NHS hospitals. Our absolute priority in this global pandemic is saving lives and we are increasing our provision of ventilators to ensure the NHS continues to have the resources it needs, through procuring more ventilators from overseas, including over 4,000 from China, scaling up the production of existing or modified designs and working to design and manufacture new devices. We currently have around 10,900 mechanical ventilators available to NHS patients across the UK, as well as 4,300 non-invasive ventilators.   This article was amended on 1 May 2020 to include a comment from a government spokesperson.","751"

The Financial Conduct Authority, which says it still believes most claimants on business interruption policies do not have the right coverage to warrant a payout, is seeking a fast-track court declaration to resolve uncertainty for many customers making claims. The FCA is taking key test cases to court that provide the greatest clarity on specific policy clauses that represent those most frequently used by insurers which have been disputed by businesses who have been rejected for a payout.     We have been clear that we believe in the majority of cases, business interruption insurance was not purchased to, and is unlikely to, cover the current emergency, said Christopher Woolard, the interim chief executive of the FCA. However, there remain a number of policies where it is clear that the firm has an obligation to pay out on a policy. For these policies, it is important that claims are assessed and settled quickly. There are also some other policies where firms may consider there is no doubt about wording and decline to pay a claim but customers may still consider there is genuine uncertainty about whether their policy provides cover. A group of more than 100 nightclubs, pubs and bars are planning coordinated legal action against the insurer Hiscox over its non-payment of business interruption insurance claims. Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers only to be told their business interruption policies do not cover the pandemic. The FCA also said on Friday that insurers may have to consider refunding some premiums or suspending monthly payments for customers who are not getting value for money from their policies during the coronavirus shutdown.    For example, boiler cover insurers may not be able to deliver on offering an annual service at this time, and liability insurance may not be temporarily relevant for businesses such as hairdressers, bars and restaurants closed as a result of the government shutdown. The FCA said it would give insurers failing to deliver on the benefits promised in their policies six months to take into account effects of coronavirus in a more rounded manner and consider appropriate action.    The FCA has also said insurance firms must look to help individual customers who are struggling to pay premiums due to the coronavirus crisis. The regulator, which has issued the same guidance in other markets including credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans, said firms must consider options including premium payment holidays, delaying charges or interest for missed payment and waiving administration and cancellation fees.","441"

It wasnt buying a house, learning Greek or finishing my novel. No: I completed Seinfeld, having spent most of the summer watching every one of the sitcoms 169  or 180, depending on how you count it  episodes, from pilot to finale. The sitcom, co-created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, which chronicled the life of rising comedian Jerry and his friends George, Elaine and Kramer, ran from 1989 to 1998, and is available to stream in the UK on All 4. Last September, Netflix acquired it in a reported $500m (400m)-plus deal and it will join the streaming services library next year. Although 2019 wasnt anywhere near approaching the doom-laden, apocalyptic hell-storm that 2020 is shaping up to be, it was nevertheless no Sunday picnic, and thus a retreat to the relative calm of the Seinfeld era  the late 80s to mid-90s  was welcome therapy. This is perhaps why, in the midst of a global pandemic, I have returned to Seinfeld. Im now making my way through the best 25 episodes, according to this list. Theres a tendency to idealise this pre-internet era. I was born in 1987, so I was two when Seinfeld first went on the air. The 90s are now being mined by younger generations and the decade has been having a fashion moment for a while now, with many women dressing in long floral dresses that resemble Elaines and men in Kramers hipster patterned shirts. As an older millennial, I have actual memories of the 90s, and so returning to that era has a comforting familiarity to it, from the clothes to the decor to the cultural references. Being part of that bridge generation, which experienced life before and after the widespread use of the internet, Seinfeld offers a glimpse of the kind of adult life we just missed out on, where dating politics revolved around the telephone and people were always getting ready to go out to the movies. In reality, I know that 1990s New York was far from wholesome. And yet there is something quite gentle about an entire sitcom episode based around trying to get a parking space (these days, youd use an app for that) or a controversial loaf of rye bread. Its a common misconception that Seinfeld is a show about nothing (this, in fact, is the pitch for Jerry and Georges failed TV sitcom-within-a-sitcom, a recurring meta-subplot throughout the series). Its original aim was to show the everyday events behind a comedians material. It is this hilarious focus on the seemingly mundane aspects of everyday life that makes Seinfeld a work of comedic genius. This is why Georges answering machine theme tune reduced me to tears of laughter recently. Its easy to forget that, long before teenagers were making their own TikToks, people who were supposed to be fully grown adults were devising their own ridiculous, themed answerphone recordings. Its a phenomenon that, like choosing a film at the video rental store (also a mainstay of Seinfeld), is now obsolete. In 2020, it would be much more difficult to masquerade as a marine biologist or to escape being broken up with by avoiding answering phone calls from your girlfriend, or to persuade your friend that the working title of War and Peace was War, What Is It Good For?   Friends has the reputation of being the ultimate comedy comfort watch, but the best bits were inspired by Seinfeld   Living in what has been termed by some as a cancel culture is also a factor in the comforting nature of Seinfeld. Larry David may have recently come out in defence of Woody Allen, but Im not about to stop watching the show. The characters are so amoral that theres a sort of freedom to how they are so unfettered in their ability to be their terribly behaved, authentic dirtbag selves without being held to such high moral standards. Thats not to say that there arent aspects of Seinfeld that havent dated in terms of attitudes and prejudices, but much of it has aged remarkably well. Its intelligent, too: I know of no other sitcom that would devote so much comedic attention to the works of John Cheever, for instance, or have a recurring joke about a fictional arthouse film (Rochelle, Rochelle: A young girls strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.) Like much of 90s television, Seinfeld takes place in a world before mass-surveillance capitalism. It is notably lacking in consumerism, and by the time Friends hit TV screens, a notable shift had taken place. Friends has the reputation of being the ultimate nostalgic comedy comfort watch, but all of the best bits were taken from or inspired by Seinfeld, just with better looking people and added hugging and learning (memorably banned on Seinfeld). Whether you have retreated into Seinfeld or are streaming other 90s TV series such as This Life, Frasier, Dawsons Creek, Ally McBeal or My So-Called Life, there are worse places to be than the 1990s. Namely, the present. Not to mention the fact that Jerrys germaphobia looks a lot more rational these days. In fact, you could say that were all Jerry now.","846"

A highlight reel of the billionaire Tesla CEOs activities since early March includes his pooh-poohing the coronavirus panic as dumb; keeping his northern California factory open in defiance of local public health orders; falsely asserting that children are essentially immune from the virus; providing a giant platform to promoters of an unproven and potentially dangerous treatment; predicting (inaccurately) that the US would have no new cases of Covid-19 by the end of April; attempting to re-open the factory before the end of the local shelter-in-place order; and calling shelter-in-place orders fascist. (Lets not even get into the drama over whether the BiPap machines he donated to some hospitals count as ventilators.)   Musks dissemination of misinformation about the virus is not without consequences   Musks dissemination of misinformation about the virus is not without consequences. He has more than 33m followers on Twitter and a fan base that tends to exalt him as a cross between Tony Stark and God. A recent study published as a letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine linked his tweet about chloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that was subsequently touted as a potential Covid-19 treatment by Donald Trump, to a dramatic surge in online demand for the prescription medication. They werent aware of it, they werent interested in it  they were trying to buy it, John Ayers, a UC San Diego professor of medicine and one of the studys authors, told the Guardian in an interview. The chloroquine document that Musk shared was an example of what the infectious disease expert Carl Bergstrom has described as quantitative bullshit  the use of statistics and data to persuade someone by overwhelming and intimidating them, without any allegiance to truth or accuracy. Last week, Musk was apparently taken in by another pair of coronavirus bullshit artists, this time a pair of doctors from Bakersfield, California. Drs Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi held a press conference to promote the idea that Covid-19 is much more widespread and much less deadly than what ivory tower figures such as Dr Anthony Fauci have said. Docs make good points, Musk tweeted, with a link to a YouTube video of the 50-minute press conference. (YouTube removed the video for spreading misinformation, but not before it received millions of views; one of the doctors has gone on to make appearances on Fox News.) The docs did not make good points. After opening his remarks by defining science like a high schooler writing a term paper (What is science? Essentially, its the study of the natural world through experiment, through observation, so thats what were doing) Erickson presented testing data from the chain of urgent care clinics they own. The clinics have performed 5,213 Covid-19 tests and had 340 positive results, which they claimed means that there is a 6.5% rate of infection in the local population. The pair performed the same math (positive tests divided by total tests) on the statewide numbers of 33,865 positive tests out of 280,900 total, to arrive at a 12% infection rate for the state. From there, they calculated that California has had a total of 4.7m infections and calculated that the death rate for people who contract Covid-19 in California is just 0.03%  much lower than that of the seasonal flu.   Related: Elon Musk rails against 'fascist' shelter-in-place orders in Tesla earnings call   None of this stands up to scrutiny. In order to assume that the rate of infection amongst a small number of people can apply to the entire population, you have to use a random and representative sample. But the people who are getting tested at urgent care clinics in California are neither random nor representative; they are people with severe symptoms or who are performing certain essential jobs. Figuring out the actual infection rate across the broader population will require careful sampling that avoids this selection bias. The Bakersfield duo used their meaningless numbers to argue that shelter-in-place orders must be lifted  a position that Musk clearly also holds. (In an extraordinary joint statement, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine jointly and emphatically condemn[ed] the pair, and suggested they were releasing biased, non-peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the publics health.) The issue is not that Musk has staked out a contrarian stance on the coronavirus. There are difficult debates that need to be had over how and when to restart the economy in order to minimize long term economic harms and maximize public health. We can and should have that discussion, and we should do it without impugning the moral character of everyone who argues for a faster loosening of restrictions. But its increasingly difficult to take Musk seriously when he makes his argument by cherry-picking numbers or relying on blatant misuse of data. Please, make your case, but make it using real facts, and not by playing fast and loose with numbers in an effort to mislead the public about what is actually happening. Otherwise you look and sound a lot less like the brilliant engineer and entrepreneur, and a lot more like just another used car salesman.","843"
"2020-05-01T10:00:22Z","books","Books","The end of coronavirus: what plague literature tells us about our future","Shortly before the London lockdown, at an eerily quiet branch of Waterstones, I managed to get my hands on The Decameron, by Boccaccio, and Daniel Defoes A Journal of the Plague Year. But Camuss The Plague had gone the way of dried pasta and toilet roll; there was just a desolate gap on the shelves where the copies had once been. The primary lesson of plague literature, from Thucydides onwards, is how predictably humans respond to such crises. Over millennia, there has been a consistent pattern to behaviour during epidemics: the hoarding, the panicking, the fear, the blaming, the superstition, the selfishness, the surprising heroism, the fixation with the numbers of the reported dead, the boredom during quarantine. Defoe would have recognised the impulses behind the strange tableaux of life interrupted in central London: piles of ice melting outside abruptly closed bars; a truck unloading gym equipment at an oligarchs house in Mayfair; jittery shoppers with overloaded trolleys. Many families, he writes, foreseeing the approach of the distemper laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so entirely, that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was quite ceased. The sudden, powerful need to know whats coming is predictable, too. We turn to historical witnesses who can explain what its like. Defoes motive for writing A Journal of the Plague Year was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Marseille in 1720. Anticipating its spread, readers wanted to know what it had been like in 1665. Defoe, responding to demand, provided them with an instant book, fashioned out of statistics, reminiscences, gossip, anecdote and blood-curdling dramatic detail. Passing through Token-House Yard in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful screeches, and then cried, O death, death, death!    Bring out your dead ... a depiction of the Great Plague in London, 1665. Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images   Defoe almost certainly didnt witness this  he would have been about five. Novelistic moments such as these would make the book compelling at any time, but right now it has a painful relevance. Defoe is particularly strong on the unpreparedness and prevarication that made the impact of the plague more severe. Or, as he puts it: I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them; and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sunk in that disaster which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided.    Bracingly vivid ... Daniel Defoes religious fanatic Solomon Eagle from A Journal of the Plague Year. Photograph: Colin Waters/Alamy   Defoe is sometimes dismissed as a hack, but his lack of vanity about his prose is one of the things that gives the book its power. Theres something amazingly bracing about his vividness and curiosity  the bills of mortality, quoted in full; minor characters such as the religious fanatic Solomon Eagle who walks around naked with a pan of burning charcoal on his head; and the imprudent John Cock, a barber who is so relieved by the apparent retreat of the epidemic that he returns to normal life too soon and pays the penalty. Moral: dont be a John Cock. So much of the behaviour of our 17th-century forebears is uncomfortably familiar. The citizens of east London watch complacently as the plague tears through the West End, and assume they will be fine. Theyre proved terrifyingly wrong. Defoe adds in a chilling parenthesis: For indeed it came upon them like an armed man when it did come. Even before germ theory, Defoes common sense and perceptiveness led him to conclusions of which our chief medical officer would approve. He gives a prescient warning about the danger of asymptomatic carriers: The plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves. If human behaviour remains dismayingly constant, one thing that has changed for the better is science and our understanding of it. Seven hundred years on, theres something deeply poignant about Boccaccios pre-scientific description of the spread of the Black Death in his native Florence. What was particularly virulent about this plague was that it would leap from the sick to the healthy whenever they were together, much as fire catches hold of dry or oily material thats brought close to it. And that was not all. Not only did speaking with the sick and spending time with them infect the healthy or kill them off, but touching the clothes of the sick or handling anything they had touched seemed to pass on the infection. You feel like the audience in a pantomime, wanting to shout across the centuries and tell him who the villain is and how he operates.    There was particularly high mortality among doctors, Thucydides tells of the plague in fifth-century Athens. Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy   Not everyone responds to plague by immersing themselves in data about epidemics. The escapist response to disaster is another predictable move and The Decameron epitomises it. After his short but terrifying description of the Florentine plague, Boccaccio sends his troupe of young characters into quarantine, where they spend the remainder of the book, swapping funny, ribald stories: the plague doesnt feature again. Its a welcome relief to lose yourself in a world of cuckolds and randy nuns. And once more, plus a change. The gilded Florentine youths are doing the 14th-century equivalent of binge-watching Sex Education on Netflix. Thomas Mann and Camus are less interested in plague itself than in using it to make existential points. The plague in Death in Venice is an avatar of death in general, the terrible mystery, the pale horse; it is something that strips away vanity and reveals unpalatable truths. In Manns novella, it is the catalyst for Von Aschenbachs humiliating descent into clownish self-destruction. At the same time, the pages dealing with the cholera epidemic are vigorous and apposite. The hotels in Venice empty swiftly, despite official protestations that there is nothing to worry about. Its a young English travel agent who finally cuts through the official flannel. The doubts he raises about administrative competence and probity are ones that in due course well all be obliged to consider. That is, he continued in an undertone and with some feeling, the official explanation, which the authorities here have seen fit to stick to.    Existential epidemic ... a scene from Neil Bartletts adaptation of Camus The Plague at the Arcola theatre, London, in 2017. Photograph: Jane Hobson/Rex/Shutterstock   Camus is the real odd one out. The Plague is often read as an allegory of the French experience under occupation, but right now there seems nothing allegorical about it: the hero, Dr Rieux, seems like a naturalistic depiction of a frontline care-worker forced into impossible decisions over who gets a ventilator. At other historical moments, the constant reflection on the meaning of the plague could seem heavy-handed  Gallic, not in a good way  but in 2020 its like reading The Crucible while your elderly parent is on trial for witchcraft. For long stretches, you forget any notion of allegory and simply wonder how Camus could have got it so right: from the panic buying of peppermints that people think will be a prophylactic, to the high mortality rate in the municipal jail, to the exhausted healthcare workers, and the terrible monotony of quarantine, something with which we are only just beginning to get acquainted. And then, of course, the plague ends. Thats the actual good news that these books bring. The epidemic always passes. The majority of people survive. Thucydides himself had it and recovered. I shall simply tell it as it happened, he promises of the plague that ravaged fifth-century Athens, and describe the features of the disease which will give anyone who studies them some prior knowledge to enable recognition should it ever strike again. Should it ever strike again is the phrase that awakens our sense of hubris. For all the talk of an unprecedented crisis, we are living through something with many precedents. There was particularly high mortality among doctors because of their particular exposure, Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago in a sentence that could appear in tomorrows paper. We have assumed that deadly epidemics belonged to a phase of history that was behind us, as quaint and irrelevant as candlelight and milking your own cows. When the number of fatalities finally peaks and dwindles, Defoes citizens pull up their windows and shout to each other to share the news. Camuss Oran is liberated; its citizens struggle to make sense of what has happened to them. Back in fifth-century Athens, the Peloponnesian war continues. Whether society changes for the better or worse, or simply stays the same, is what we will find out.","1451"

Picnics may be out for now, but an assortment of rugs and mats placed around Sutton Ecology Centre, a secluded two-hectare nature reserve tucked away behind a main road in Carshalton, south London, are playing host to a more subterranean kind of socialising.
The amorous slow worms, which come in an array of polished silvers, golds and browns depending on age and gender, mate for up to 10 hours at a time in May; theres a good chance that peeling back the corner of one of the mats in the centre during peak season will reveal two entwined.

This week, the Guardian's Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.
Around 55% of the worlds population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Natures role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.
The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.
In this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.





Though they are rarely seen out in the open, slow worms are common throughout the UK. But the ecology centre  which packs in woodlands, wildflower meadows, and a pond currently teeming with tadpoles and wildfowl chicks  is a hotspot.

It is positioned at the point where the chalky North Downs meets London clay, in an area fed by one of only about 200 chalk streams in the world, says David Warburton, senior biodiversity officer for the London Borough of Sutton, which owns the centre. The site is ideal for reptiles such as slow worms. We have a really healthy population of them, but they are isolated by surrounding roads and housing.
The reptiles  which live for up to 30 years (the oldest on record was a captive 54-year-old male in Copenhagen zoo)  feast on slugs, snails and insects. In turn they provide food for various birds, as well as badgers and hedgehogs  numbers of which have declined dramatically in the past two decades.
Like all six of the UKs reptile species, slow worms are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, making it illegal to intentionally kill, injure or sell them. But this doesnt stop them regularly falling victim to carelessly wielded shovels, a risk that could increase as lockdown increases the amount of time people spend in their gardens during the slow worm mating season.

Just be mindful that theyre around, says Warburton. They are not at all dangerous. If you find one, be careful not to spook it, or it could shed its tail  which is their main defence mechanism. But by all means get close and marvel at how great they are, look at their eyelids, ear holes, forked tongue, and then leave them where you found them. Leaving out covers such as old rugs or corrugated iron in a sunny spot can encourage them into the garden, he says.
OKeeffe recommends a bit of messiness in the garden to create a more holistic ecosystem: not mowing areas of lawn, leaving piles of logs and leaves, and ensuring gaps under fences to allow hedgehogs and other animals in and out.
We often have a stall at local events and I remember one lady being delighted, saying Oh, Ive been feeling guilty about the wild patch at the bottom of my garden  now Im going to call it my wildlife area.
In normal times the ecology centre welcomes 7,000 schoolchildren a year. The species that call the wildlife centre home, not least the population of slow worms, are a big draw. Lots of kids havent got any frame of reference for things  snails, worms, everythings icky, says Warburton.
The loss of half of the worlds wildlife is at the forefront of the centres work. I dont think that most people have cottoned onto the fact that there is a biodiversity crisis, says Warburton. We teach the kiddies so that they care and will do something about it. Activities like building a stick den, picking up a snail  it helps them to not be scared to get their hands dirty. We try to turn their fear into fascination.
An understanding of natural processes isnt always better among local adults, according to Warburton, especially in urban areas. He describes the reaction of the public when his team introduced native cattle to the Roundshaw Downs in 2012, a rare chalk grassland three miles south-east, on the site of Londons first international airport in Croydon. They used castrated male Sussex cattle, which are naturally hornless and very placid. Well, youd think wed released lions. Some people were apoplectic. I had to say: This is not Jurassic Park we are creating!
He wonders if the current crisis might bring about a shift in peoples interest in their local wildlife, including the mysterious slow worm. Hopefully they might realise you dont have to go to a national park to see cool and interesting species. Once youve seen them in your garden, the whole world opens up.

Large-scale tracing efforts have been proven to work in other countries, including South Korea and Germany, and are considered crucial to get the United States economy back on track. But tracing efforts in a nation as large and diverse as the US come with unique challenges, and California, the countrys most populous state, is one of the first to start to take those challenges on.   Related: 'My mom's life was disposable': inside the California nursing homes unable to contain Covid-19   To set up an effective contact tracing program, California will have to increase its health department staff five or 10-fold, experts told the Guardian. The state is eventually planning to recruit 10,000 tracers, according to Gavin Newsom, the states governor  and test up to 80,000 people each day, relying on paid health workers and volunteers. But some municipalities are ahead of their curve, and are already beginning to recruit and train tracers. Putting in place a system for tracing and tracking the contacts of people who have tested positive is a is an absolute essential pillar we need to build up and put in place before we even think about reopening the country, said Susie Welty, a global health expert at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), who is helping build the contact tracing program in the city. Despite its techie reputation, San Francisco has so far eschewed smartphone tracking and contact tracing apps in favor of old-fashioned phone calls. Experts from UCSF have recruited more than 100 city workers who cannot do their regular jobs under the current shelter-in-place rules, taught them healthcare privacy laws, and coached them on how to call Covid-19 patients, assess their needs and ask them about any recent interactions with family, friends and neighbors. Without revealing the infected persons identity, trackers call everyone they may have interacted with and ask them to self-quarantine for 14 days. We know this is really stressful and onerous to the people we call, said Dr Mike Reid, an assistant professor in infectious disease at UCSF who is leading the citys contact tracing efforts. Tracers help connect sick or exposed people to any healthcare services they may need, offer to have the city deliver them food and medicine while theyre in quarantine, and offer them a hotel room if they are unhoused or unable to isolate from family members at home. Right now, the city has the capacity to offer tests to everyone with symptoms, Reid said  but ideally, medical centers will also be able to test everyone who may have been exposed to the virus, regardless of whether they look sick. Look, were just getting started here. This is early, early days, Reid said. But the idea is well slowly build up our capacity to trace and test so that were prepared for when everything opens back up. With stringent distancing measures in place, the job has been relatively manageable, Reid said. The average San Franciscan has only three or four contacts  and theyre usually family members. But once bars, restaurants and other workplaces reopen, contact tracing will be essential to quickly catch and contain new outbreaks. Testing will also have to be scaled up.

The state has a shaky record, failing to protect unhoused and incarcerated populations throughout the pandemic. The systematic biases in our society leave Latino workers most vulnerable to the coronavirus, said David Hayes-Bautista, a professor of public health and medicine at UCLA. And these are the people who are going to be hardest to contact trace. Immigrant communities are justifiably worried that each time they share information about their status and location, it will come back to haunt them, Hayes-Bautista said. It makes sense that people are scared. Local governments can make sure people feel safe and protected by deputizing local non-profits and indigenous and immigrant rights advocacy groups to help in the tracing efforts, he said. In rural Madera county, where the local officials have deputized sheriffs in plainclothes to contact trace from the very beginning of the outbreak in early March, officials have taken care to avoid asking anyone about their immigration status and reassuring residents that their health information will remain confidential, said Sara Bosse, the countys public health director. In the farming community, where more than 50% of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, the city has also partnered with community health organizations to reach unhoused and other vulnerable populations. San Francisco has similarly publicized that the contact tracing is voluntary, confidential, and culturally and linguistically appropriate. Immigration status will have no bearing on these conversations. Nationally, the US still has a long way to go before contact tracing can become a reliable part of the strategy to reopen. The existing public health system is currently capable of providing only a fraction of the contact tracing and voluntary self-isolation capacity required to meet the Covid-19 challenge, a prominent group of public health officials wrote Monday in letter to House and Senate leaders, noting that lawmakers would need to allocate an additional $46bn to tracing and isolation efforts. Nationally, at least 100,000 contact tracers will be needed to see after Americans who have fallen ill, or have been exposed, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Others estimate that a workforce of 180,000 to 300,000 will be required. Dr Joia Mukherjee, the chief medical officer at Partners in Health in Massachusetts, who is leading the nations first statewide contact tracing effort there, said shes found that calling and educating everyone who may have been exposed to the coronavirus is especially important right now, in the US. Mukherjee, who has worked to fight outbreaks and pandemics around the world, pointed at anti-lockdown protests and misinformation swirling online. Proven scientific fact about an infectious disease was completely shunned and mocked by the president, she said. So we need to make sure people have the information they need to stay safe.","1036"

As the days spent in our homes blur together and become indistinguishable, outside in the world huge shifts in consciousness are happening.
Just as it was unimaginable that things could go back to normal after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, so it is that policy, investments and our collective imaginations over the coming years will be overshadowed by a virus that took fewer than 100 days to shut the world down.
These strange months may be the first of an era defined by hyper-awareness of the threat posed by pandemics. It is too soon to say what that will look like. Each day brings shocks and possibilities, illuminates a little more of our new reality. Epidemiologists will study the past five months for decades; historians even longer.
But already we can see the rough contours forming. We are learning what works against Covid-19. And, surveying the wreckage of the third coronavirus to become an epidemic this century  along with two animal influenzas and several waves of Ebola  lessons are emerging about the kinds of societies that will be required to withstand the future outbreaks that scientists tell us are inevitable, and increasing.

You must move fast

China announced the discovery of a pneumonia of unknown origin on the afternoon of 31 December. The announcement barely registered in a world preparing to celebrate the end of the decade. 
 But that same day in Taiwan, the government in Taipei ordered any planes arriving from Wuhan to remain on the tarmac so airport staff could inspect the health of all those onboard.
China resisted implementing country-wide health screenings or taking temperature readings in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for the next fortnight, even as doctors in the city were reporting floods of patients struggling to breathe, and as leaders in Beijing became aware they were confronting the most severe challenge since Sars.
In the meantime, Taiwans Centers for Disease Control was monitoring arrivals from Wuhan, quarantining any person with a fever or cough and urging its citizens to avoid any unnecessary travel to Hubei.

In China cases would have been cut by 95% acting three weeks earlier

A study released in March underlined the importance of acting fast. Had China implemented widespread testing, a cordon sanitaire around Hubei and other measures a week earlier, it would have reduced Chinas caseload by 66%, the researchers argued. Acting three weeks earlier would have cut cases by 95%.
As of this week, Taiwan has confirmed 429 positive coronavirus cases and six deaths.
The lesson for governments was underlined by Michael Ryan, a surgeon and the executive director of the World Health Organizations health emergencies programme, in a press conference in March. Be fast. Have no regrets. You must be the first mover. The virus will always get you if you dont move quickly, he said. If you need to be right before you move, you will never win  Speed trumps perfection.

We know what works to contain it

Months into this epidemic, even basic information about the coronavirus is still unclear. How infectious is it? How deadly? Leaders make life-and-death decisions based on best guesses. We are flying the plane as its being built, says Ashley Arabasadi, a policy adviser at the US-based institute Management Sciences for Health.
Yet the basic principles for containing a disease, developed and refined with reference to hundreds of previous epidemics, have held true for Covid-19.
The successful examples and failed examples in containing the spread of the virus have something in common, says Yanzhong Huang, the director of the Centre for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University in the US.
The countries that have implemented early and extensive testing, such as South Korea and Iceland, have been able to keep their societies relatively open, without loosing the virus into their populations.
Singapore kept a lid on its initial wave by diligently retracing the steps of people who tested positive for Covid-19. Those they came into sustained contact with were often put in home isolation, with harsh penalties for breaking it. The sick were quarantined in hospitals, even if their symptoms were mild.
When containing cases is no longer possible, early evidence from Europe shows that physical distancing measures, implemented early, flatten the curve and reduce the overall size of a countrys outbreak.
Irrespective of the society, the level of development, the preparedness of the health system, early lockdown worked in containing the epidemic, whereas a late lockdown led to a massive outbreak, says Joel Ruet, the president of the Bridge Tank thinktank, which conducted the research.
 the hard part is implementing it

In 2014, as Ebola was spreading in west Africa, Rebecca Katz remembers hearing frustrations from some of the countries helping to fund the response.
They would be asking things like: How dare Sierra Leone not close schools during an Ebola outbreak? says the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center. For a long time its been easy for donor countries to cast judgment on recipient countries for their behaviour in disease transmission.
The coronavirus outbreak has made clear that it is a universal problem: even countries that know what works, and have the capacity to act, still hesitate.
Some with strong liberal traditions, such as Britain, balked initially at the prospect of drastically curbing civil rights. Italian industry groups are reported to have strongly resisted the idea of shutting down Lombardy, one of the engines of the countrys economy. Developing countries such as Pakistan have had to balance slowing the spread of the disease with the disastrous consequences of closing the farms and construction sites where the poorest work.
Its really easy for me to say, hey, we should institute social distancing measures and close schools and cut the link between those susceptible to the disease and the infectious, says Katz. Knowing what the larger societal impact is makes it harder to pull the trigger.
There were blind spots in the way countries prepared. A global index released in October concluded the US was more ready than anywhere else to fight a pandemic. But the scorecard, based on WHO methodology, focused more on technical capacity than government processes, says Alexandra Phelan, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
 Official figures show the US has had the largest and most deadly outbreak, exacerbated by a slow initial response, mismanagement of testing and poor coordination between states and the federal government.
As this outbreak has demonstrated, you can have the best labs in the world, the best notification systems and software, but if you dont have the appropriate governance of when to use these powers  they dont function, Phelan says.

Civil liberties face their greatest test in a generation

Digital surveillance tools that might have been closely scrutinised in normal times have been urgently rolled out over recent weeks. More than 40 countries have implemented some form of surveillance or censorship in the name of fighting the coronavirus, according to one estimate.
These tools have created a world that might have appeared dystopian a few months ago. In Hong Kong and Bahrain, people in quarantine are being issued with electronic bracelets that track their movements. Drones equipped with cameras hover over some Indian neighbourhoods warning residents they are being watched. Israel has revealed it has secretly been amassing peoples phone data and is tapping that database to find potential coronavirus cases.

""Drones equipped with cameras hover over some Indian neighbourhoods warning residents they are being watched""

South Korea credited its advanced use of technology with helping to uncover clusters of cases that would otherwise have gone undetected. About 81% of Koreans approve of the surveillance measures there, according to one poll.
Human rights advocates acknowledge we are living through an emergency, but worry governments will use fears of future outbreaks to justify keeping many of these tools in place  whether or not they help.
We are facing an immense challenge, but necessity is the question, says Akshaya Kumar, the director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch. Some of these measures are just peering into peoples lives and taking power without a clear sunset clause, and without a sense that theyre really needed to combat the virus.
The potential for abuse is high, the UN warned in a report last week. What is justified during an emergency now may become normalised once the crisis has passed.

Public trust is a governments most valuable asset. The next months will strain it

There is no precedent for half the worlds population living under some kind of lockdown. It might just be the single largest collective act undertaken by humanity.
Its successful execution requires extraordinary public trust in their governments, says Lars Trgrdh, a Swedish historian who studies trust in institutions over time. If you trust the government is working for your good, and you trust other citizens to follow the rules, you have huge advantages for collective action, he says.

Mobility in Swedens parks and gardens

In places where trust in government is weak, fear has worked to clear the streets. In South Africa, police used whips to enforce a national curfew. Indian migrant labourers walking home were made to squat and crawl as punishment for being outside, while in Jordan, more than 1,600 people were imprisoned in the first three days of quarantine.
But restrictions implemented in low-trust societies could engender a backlash, says Trgrdh. And thats what happening in Southern Europe and the US right now where you see a lot of disobedience.
Over the next months, governments are going to allow people to resume their lives amid the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression. Should new waves of the virus be detected, states may again ask their citizens to return home.
Managing this is going to require significant stores of public trust, that in some places are quickly eroding. If people agree to do something in the long term, without a threat hanging over their heads, they are more likely to keep doing it, Trgrdh says. The alternative is fear, distrust, and chaos, and that isnt good, no matter what the policy might be.

Leaders who deny science are a liability

Many leaders have enjoyed what may be a temporary surge in popularity as frightened citizens rally around them in a crisis. Two notable exceptions have been the US president, Donald Trump, and his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, whose ratings have declined sharply.
Both men, rightwing populists who frame their presidencies as revolts against the elites, including scientific authorities, have been highly skilled at influencing the media environment. But the coronavirus is a unique test. It spreads and kills regardless of how it is being framed online or in the media. It emphasises the importance of experts. Success depends on rallying the country together.

Retail and recreation mobility

Leaders such as Trump deploy simple messages: insider versus outsider, us versus them, says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor at Temple University in the US, who studies the politics of information. And they are having an ideological crisis in how to manage the message here. This is a very complicated information sphere, which you cant put into us and them boxes  because in this case everybody is the us.
Rather than rewarding bravado, the moment appears to favour leaders who can be honest about the uncertainty inherent in fighting a virus, says Kathleen Bachynski, an assistant professor of public health at Muhlenberg College. If leaders are not willing or able to be honest about these limitations, there will be this loss of credibility  and it wont be because they are wrong, its because information is changing.
Those overseeing some of the more successful responses, such as Germanys Angela Merkel or Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, have been praised for their ability to project empathy and communicate complex ideas.
Asked to explain Germanys metrics for deciding when to ease the lockdown, Merkel fluently explained the need to bring down the reproducibility number of the virus so that the health system can cope with its continued spread.
In a press conference a few days earlier, Trump answered the same question by pointing to his head. The metrics right here, he said. Thats my metrics.
The responses to the virus in both Brazil and the US are increasingly being led by state leaders, who are bypassing the federal government and coordinating directly with each other.

Self-sufficiency matters again

Governments will not soon forget the desperate global scramble for personal protective equipment and medical supplies they have engaged in these past months. Nor the sight of doctors and nurses forced to guard against infection using bin bags and homemade masks.
Several countries have already restricted the exporting of some pharmaceuticals and more than a dozen have imposed bans on selling some food abroad. The UN has warned that if quarantines persist, food supply chains in some places might start to be disrupted from this month.

Baseline mobility in grocery areas

The message is being received. EU countries are emphasising the importance of increasing the strategic autonomy of the bloc and ensuring it produces its own essential goods.
Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, told village leaders last week the most important lesson from the pandemic was the need for self-reliance. We should not look to other countries to satisfy our needs, he said.
Australia is one of several countries said to be re-examining the exposure of food, fuel and medical supplies in particular to global supply chains, the fragility of which have been exposed.
 but the world cannot beat the virus without cooperating

The coronavirus got lucky: it emerged at a low point for global cooperation.
Countries recognised after Sars that sharing information, coordinating responses and pooling resources such as protective gear, medicine and tests was vital. A set of international regulations that came into force in 2007 laid the groundwork for this cooperation.
As Covid-19 started to spread, the regulations were virtually ignored. The biggest surprise was how quickly the plans were not at all consulted, Katz says. The world was quick to throw out the global governance tools we had so carefully negotiated.
The lack of cooperation has weakened the worlds response, public health experts argue. A global stimulus package might have put a floor under the economic catastrophe unfolding in many countries. Coordinated shutdowns and reopenings would have slowed the spread of the virus and could speed up the recovery.



   default
  


We might have avoided chaos in the global market for medical and protective equipment, with reports of the US waving wads of cash to re-divert planeloads of masks bound for France, and Israel running clandestine spy operations to source testing kits.
The last four years have seen a profound shift to governments that are protectionist and nationalistic and who argue the multilateral system doesnt benefit them, Phelan says. Those of us who work in global health or other international problems know were interconnected. That global problems required global solutions.

Austerity and inequality make us less resilient

No economy could withstand the shock of a large slice of the workforce suddenly ordered home. But the virus has irradiated weaknesses that have made the outbreak deadlier, and will make its aftermath hurt more.
The problems with tying health insurance to employment in the US have become even more obvious: the 26 million Americans who have filed for benefits over the past month did not just lose their jobs, many also lost their medical coverage.
Britain has the NHS, but a decade of austerity had weakened the system and left the country in demonstrably worse health when the virus struck.
The rise of precarious gig-economy jobs and zero-hours contracts has created a mass of workers without access to sick and paid leave, incentivising some to keep working when the entire community needs them to stay home. Insecure work and barriers to healthcare disproportionately burden people from ethnic minorities and poor people: both are dying from Covid-19 at a higher rate in the US and Britain.
Governments that have spent decades scaling back social welfare systems are now scrambling to build new ones on the fly. The world is realising that there are many millions of workers who have fallen through the cracks of the existing social protection systems, says Luca Pellerano, a senior social protection specialist with the International Labour Organisation.
They are not in forms of protected employment, yet they are not poor enough to fall into the often quite narrow and shallow [existing] anti-poverty programmes. Countries with very fragile systems, with big coverage gaps, are scrambling to find solutions and are clearly behind the curve.

The poor and migrants cannot be invisible

Singapores response has been lauded as a model. Its government moved fast, utilising technology, exemplary public communication and the traditional tools of outbreak control to corral its first wave of cases to about 200.
Then last week, it announced it had discovered thousands of new infections, almost all of them among migrant workers living in dormitories on industrial estates on the outskirts of the sleek city-state. Rights groups say little attention was paid to the more than 1 million migrant workers, even as restrictions on crowding and movement were rolled out.



Viruses can see the people who are usually invisible to policymakers and the public. The conditions in which they work and live are everyones problem.
The same is true of the residents of Dharavi, a Mumbai slum where almost 1 million people are crammed together within sight of the skyscrapers and penthouses apartments of some of the wealthiest people in Asia. More than 200 cases have been discovered so far. City authorities acknowledge it will be virtually impossible to halt the spread of the disease among these communities.

"2020-05-01T09:45:20Z","us-news","US news","How Trump has tipped the scales in America's most powerful courts","The US supreme court may be the highest in the land, but because of the small number of cases it hears each year, justice usually does not get that far. Final rulings in the vast majority of federal lawsuits are issued one tier lower, in the 13 appeals courts spread across the country.  embed  And this is now where key policy questions increasingly land, because partisanship has slowed legislative dealmaking in the United States in recent years. It is in these appeals courts where judges serving lifetime appointments have extraordinary power over issues as public as the climate crisis and as private as the right to choose. That longer-term trend has converged with a much more recent development: Donald Trumps appointment of a record number of appeals court judges installed with unprecedented speed, as part of a grand project coordinated with conservative legal activists to remake the federal bench for generations to come. Nearly 30% of the 179 active circuit court judges are now Trump appointees. Owing to this extraordinary push, the ideological makeup of the courts has slowly tipped in a conservative direction. Since 2017, three of the courts have flipped from a majority of judges appointed by a Democratic president to a Republican-appointment majority. The US court of appeals for the eleventh circuit, which oversees cases in Florida, Alabama and Georgia, has gone from an 8-3 majority of judges appointed by Democrats, with one vacancy, to a 7-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans. Elsewhere, Trump has flipped the second and third Circuits, and he has effectively flipped a fourth court, the ninth circuit, some analysts think. I still like to think theres a bottom line for even conservative Trump appointees on the court of appeals, that theres a line there that they wont cross over, that well remain a country of laws and not men, said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. But who knows? Together the ninth, eleventh and fifth circuit courts decide thousands of cases a year with broad repercussions for daily life in America. Heres a look at how the three courts are changing under Trump. Eleventh circuit Florida, Georgia, Alabama Key issue: Who gets to vote Floridians struck a historic blow in favor of universal suffrage in the 2018 midterm elections, passing a constitutional amendment that restored the right to vote to felons who had completed their sentences. With a 30-point margin of victory, the will of the voters was unambiguous. But the reality of voting in Florida, a key presidential swing state, has been slow to change. Last May, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a law curtailing the right of felons to vote who owe money from legal penalties, significantly rolling back the 2018 referendum result. In reply, would-be voters sued the Republican governor, and now voting rights in Florida are in a very different place from where they seemed to be in November 2018. Instead of being before the electorate, the issue is before the federal courts, which means it is in the hands of judges appointed by Trump. In a ruling expected in the coming months, Trumps judges could strip the right to vote from the 1.5 million people who had it restored in the 2018 referendum, in defiance of the popular will, potentially swaying the results of the November 2020 election, in a swing state that Trump needs to hold in order to return to the White House. We had fears about what these jurists would do when they got on the bench, just from their records, said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of People for the American Way (PFAW), which maintains a tracking tool of Trumps judges called Confirmed Judges, Confirmed Fears. This administration more than any has really been putting movement ideologues on the bench who have an agenda. And once we got far enough into the administration, we realized that the judges about whom we had fears were issuing decisions that were highly problematic. Rulings by circuit courts, which average about 13 active judges each, are typically issued by randomly selected three-judge panels, meaning that the overall makeup of the court does not directly come into play in every ruling. Over time, however, the composite ideological orientation of a court comes through. And Trumps judges on the eleventh circuit have shown what critics see as a hostility to a central issue for the state of Florida and the country: voting rights. The legal team representing voters in the Florida felony disenfranchisement case claims in part that the state law was passed with racial and discriminatory intent in violation of the constitution. This issue of felony disenfranchisement is a really important issue in the United States, said Sean Morales-Doyle, a Brennan Center lawyer who is litigating the case. Floridas voters came forward and really made clear that they rejected this, that this wasnt a policy that voters on any part of the political spectrum believe in. And then we promptly saw the Florida legislature attempt to undo that. Ninth circuit California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona Key issue: Immigration Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit has gone from an 18-7 majority of active judges appointed by Democrats, with four vacancies, to a much narrower 16-13 majority of judges appointed by Democrats. But the courts senior judges, who carry about half the caseload of active judges, also issue rulings  and at the senior level, Republican appointees now outnumber Democratic appointees 10-3. Maybe its already flipped in some ways, said Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection, of the ninth circuit. Whatever the balance on the bench, activists express concern about decisions coming down from the court, historically one of the most progressive in the country.  Trump judges on the ninth circuit have been especially abrasive in immigration cases, denying spousal visas in violation of long precedent and dismissing asylum claims, including in a case where the plaintiff had evidence of murders of multiple family members in his home country. In one dissent, a Trump-appointed judge supported a Trump proclamation banning entry to any would-be immigrant who could not prove either possession of health insurance or an ability to pay for healthcare. The judge ruled that the government would suffer immediate, irreparable harm unless the health insurance screen was allowed to stand, quoting Trump on the financial and public health burdens that the uninsured can impose. Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who analyzes the shifting makeup of federal courts under Trump, said the ninth circuit had undergone a big change and noted that the outsized caseload of the circuit, the biggest in the country covering 60 million people, often required visiting judges to fill in. Fifth circuit Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi Key issue: healthcare Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit has gone from a 9-5 majority of active judges appointed by Republicans, with three vacancies, to an 11-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans, with one vacancy. Trump judges on the circuit have boosted key administration projects, especially on immigration, greenlighting $3.6bn in spending on the border wall and taking a chilly view of asylum claims. They have issued rulings inimical to employment equality and fair housing claims, and protected law enforcement from liability for excessive use of force. In a case with ominous resonance under the coronavirus pandemic, the court has defended objections on religious grounds to immunizations. Its worth pointing out that four of the courts, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth, had Republican-appointed majorities when Trump took office, said Wheeler. So he has perhaps strengthened the Republican-appointee majority on those courts by putting younger and perhaps ideologically more committed judges in the place of older Republicans.","1308"

1:B - Batty dedicated an entire chapter of his 2001 book to Vinnie Jones, one of his closest mates at Leeds United in the late 1980s and early 1990s. That night, Jones had broken into Battys house, attacked him in his bed for a laugh and then destroyed Battys front garden with his Mini. , 2:D - This is from Mark Hughes's book Sparky: Barcelona, Bayern and Back. Hughes moved to Barcelona from Manchester United in 1986, but his spell in Spain was unsuccessful and he moved back to England in 1988 after a loan spell at Bayern Munich. Hughes described his time in Catalonia as ""a full-blown, X-rated horror story."", 3:A - This is from Rodney Marsh's candidly named autobiography I Was Born A Loose Cannon. The book was published in 2010 and charts his time playing for Fulham, QPR and Manchester City, among others. The centre-fold pictures of that book include a shot with Mike Tyson and his Celebrity Come Dine With Me dinner date alongside Paul Ross and Abi Titmuss., 4:C - Vardy released his autobiography From Nowhere, My Story in 2016, shortly after Leicester Citys remarkable title triumph. He started his prologue with this story, in which he gets a tattoo from Wes Morgans tattoo parlour on the day Leicester sealed the title., 5:C - Sam Allardyce describes his villa in Spain he bought with his wife in his 2015 book Big Sam, which was published a year before his hiring and firing as England manager. The introduction also included this pearler: ""He was a pest at first. But the grandkids named him Hector and hes become our adopted pet. He might be a she, but Im not sure how you tell with dragonflies."", 6:A - Nicol left Liverpool in 1994 for Notts County, five years after the Hillsborough disaster. Writing in his book Five League Titles and a Packet of Crisps, he added: Consciously and subconsciously, it was eating away at me. Eventually, I just couldnt take it anymore. God alone knows how the survivors and families have coped., 7:B - In his book, Quiet Leadership, Winning Hearts, Minds and Matches, Ancelotti recalls his conversation with Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi when he arrived at the club in 2001. Milan signed Alessandro Nesta was for 30m and Ancelotti went on to the Champions League in the 2002-03 season, his first full campaign in charge, as well in 2006-07, with Nesta partnering Paolo Maldini at the back., 8:D - Published a few months after his death in 2016, Cruyffs autobiography, My Turn, recounts the zenith of Total Football with the Dutch national side at the 1974 World Cup. The first step was to bring enjoyment to the crowd, the next was to win. I had no real idea of the significance of it all at the time, he explained. The Netherlands beat Brazil 2-0 on the way to the World Cup final, where they lost 2-1 to West Germany., 9:A - In his 2013 book, My Autobiography, Ferguson talks about meeting Carlos Queiroz, who would become his assistant manager. Of all the ones who worked alongside me, he was the best, no doubt about that, Ferguson wrote., 10:D - Bartons autobiography, No Nonsense, became a bestseller when it was released in 2016. It charted his career through stints at Manchester City, Newcastle United, QPR, Marseille, Burnley and Rangers, as well as his spell in prison for assault in 2008.

"2020-05-01T09:36:13Z","uk-news","UK news","Should I be like my mother, who danced in the streets during the Blitz?","Monday Anxiety is still the first feeling of which I am aware every morning. First as a sense of unease as I regain consciousness and then physical and mental distress as I reconnect with the reality of the new normal. It can still take me a couple of hours of hiding under the duvet before I feel brave enough to get up and have breakfast. Some things have changed, though. Thankfully my dreams are no longer quite so terrifying. Rather, they have switched into something more distant and desolate where I am disconnected from the present. One night I dreamed first I was with my son, who was learning to fly in the Lofoten Islands  somewhere Ive never been (nor have I watched the TV series Twin) and would not be unable to place on a map of Norway  and then that I was in a spaceship with Buzz Aldrin as we were flying to the edge of the solar system. Buzz didnt seem that pleased to have me for company. Whats also changed is that during the day some of the anxiety now dissipates into sadness and depression. Sadness both at the scale of the crisis  we are now well past the chief scientific advisers best result death toll of 20,000, with no end in sight  and at my own personal losses. In particular the separation from my family, friends and colleagues. In the early days of the lockdown I was somehow able to kid myself that maybe the quarantine wouldnt last that long. But now its sunk in that the government is making things up as it goes along, life may not return to normal for many months and that all plans will have to be put on hold. I remember my mother telling me how she and some friends danced down Piccadilly during an air raid in the second world war (Im assuming they were a bit pissed) before a warden angrily shepherded them into a shelter. I cant quite work out whether I need a bit more or a bit less of that sort of spirit. Tuesday While almost every other sporting body has either cancelled or rearranged fixtures for the months ahead, the Premier League still appears to be under the delusion that it can not only somehow reschedule the remaining games of the current season but also start the next season more or less on time. I know the clubs dont want to sacrifice any TV money or refund season ticket holders, but I cant help wondering what part of the governments coronavirus advice they have somehow missed. Clearly, as a Spurs fan, I would be more than happy for the current season to be declared null and void and for Champions League places to be decided on where clubs finished in May 2019, but I can see that might not be a universally popular choice. But someone has got to make a decision quickly, even if it means pissing some people off, as the situation is getting ridiculous. Still, at least there is someone I know who is still making money out of football. Louis, the son of my friend Kevin, is 42% up on his portfolio investment in the FOOTIE, footballs equivalent of the FTSE, where you buy and sell shares in footballers. Often ones youve never seen or heard of apart from a three-minute YouTube compilation. Louis best investment is a 10 stake in an Italian teenager, of whom Id never heard, called Sandro Tonali  bought because he had a passing resemblance to Andrea Pirlo  now showing a profit of 220%. Despite a lengthy tutorial from Louis, Im still not entirely sure how the FOOTIE really works  apparently Paul Pogbas current value of 8 per share has fluctuated wildly in the past few months despite him not having played a single minute of football  but apparently it has become the go-to site for all fans with a few quid to risk who are overwhelmed by the mass monotony. Wednesday Some of my more intrepid colleagues have made a point of still going into Westminster so that they can observe 90% of MPs dialling in their contributions by Zoom on eight screens in the chamber. It wont surprise you that I have taken a rather more timid approach, preferring not to take my chances on public transport and following proceedings via Parliament TV instead. I already feel I have used up most of my nine lives. The distance has done nothing to convince me that the governments response to the coronavirus has often felt as if it has been getting worse rather than better. First we had Boris Johnson on his return to Downing Street declaring that other countries were looking at our apparent success. I wonder what an apparent failure would look like. Then we have had three contradictory briefings on Dominic Cummingss contributions to the governments scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage). First was that he had definitely never attended a Sage meeting. Next that he had been present but not involved. And finally, that rather than being a supporter of herd immunity as it had originally been reported, he single-handedly saved the UK by making the scientists introduce an immediate lockdown. Weve also had Michael Gove talk up his HMRC academy for training 50,000 new customs officers (current applications = zero) to cope with new post-Brexit customs regulations, while Dominic Raab insisted the coronavirus was a magnificent opportunity for the UK to strike an advantageous Brexit deal with the EU by 31 December and that we shouldnt believe everything Michel Barnier or the IMF say about the economy shrinking by 35%. But pride of place definitely has to go to Priti Patel, whose performance before the home affairs select committee was every bit the car crash that was anticipated. At one point, the home secretary told the committee that the reason the UK didnt follow other governments guidelines for self-isolation at airports was that we had both more and fewer international passengers arriving. Schrdingers airport. The public inquiry that will follow all this should make for compelling reading.    The bleach sure as hell works on my hair ... Donald Trump. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters   Thursday Every crisis has its winners. The coronavirus has therapists, funeral directors and makers of sports equipment. With the change in temperature, I have finally had to admit I am basically a fair-weather cyclist. Pedalling my way up and down the same hill on a bike that is far too small for me for an hour in the wind and the rain really doesnt appeal, and with it looking less and less likely that gyms will be reopening, something had to give. So I have found an online distributor that can deliver by 1 June  most manufacturers can now only promise July delivery, such is the demand  and I have ordered an exercise bike for 229, which means I will only have to endure another month on my wifes bike outdoors. For someone who prefers their exercise to be dull, repetitive and painful, this is the ideal solution. Not least because it offers up the possibility of my own 24-hour-gym at home. If I cant sleep because Im feeling anxious, I will shortly be able to get up at 2am and cycle precisely nowhere to relieve the cortisol levels. What could be better? Ive also ordered myself some resistance bands, which my friend Alex insists are nearly as effective as weights. If all goes to plan, I will be all sorted in case gyms are closed for a year. Though as soon as Virgin Active in Streatham does reopen, I will be one of the first back in to nab my favourite cross-trainer. Ive always been a creature of habit and Ive been going to the same gym for well over 20 years now, so why would I stop? Mens (in)sana, in corpore sano. Friday Before my wife took up pottery seriously about eight years ago, I had only a passing interest in ceramics. It was an art form I didnt really get. But having watched Jill develop her work  and having lived through her many failures as well as the successes  pottery has become yet another serious passion of mine. To go alongside football, opera and Panini stickers. One of the things I most love about ceramics is the potters themselves. When you buy a piece directly from an artist, they are always keen to explain exactly how the work was made. What clays and glazes were used, whether it was thrown, handbuilt or both, and how many times and at what temperature the pot was fired. Its as if ceramics is a form of artistic alchemy and even the creators arent entirely sure of how their work will actually look when it emerges from the kiln  and want to share the process with you. This week one potter called John, some of whose works we already have in our collection, took this to the extreme by not just sending me a pot he had made but including a letter, with accompanying photographs, of exactly how it was made. He had started by going to an old gravel pit in the Netherlands, where he had dug down to the 2.5m-year-old clay underneath, which he had taken back to the studio to be churned in a bakers dough mixer before throwing it on the wheel. There was plenty more technical detail, but what I loved most was his end note. Then of course there is my input into the making, the joy of throwing and all that happens along the way, be it philosophical, spontaneous, accidental, expressive, all of which play a part but may have different emphasis on the day of making. I wrote some weeks ago that I have taken to talking to my pots. Some of my friends thought I was losing it a bit. But now, I feel vindicated. Because if you know a pot well enough, every time you look at it, it will talk right back to you. Digested week, digested: Mainlining Dettol.","1669"
"2020-05-01T09:35:29Z","world","World news","Has Sweden's coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists?","Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 mortality rate is among the 10 highest in the world, at 240 per million population and steadily rising, and many of the nursing homes in Stockholm are now affected. The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The countrys chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion. But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of the bent twig, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it. It began with a self-conceit that seemed more comical than harmful. Why, one columnist asked, could we not just let Sweden be Sweden? Others suggested we brand ourselves smart Sweden or kind Sweden, the country immune to the hysteria of southern Europe. The next step was the ridicule and delegitimisation of opponents. A group of 22 scientists wrote a joint opinion column arguing for a drastic change of strategy. But within a few hours no one was paying attention to the substance of their arguments. Instead the debate came to revolve entirely around the fact that they used Covid-19 death numbers that made Sweden look worse than the more cautious estimates of the public health agency. This was certainly clumsy, but did not undermine their main conclusion. Nor does the fact that Sweden does indeed now have close to six times more deaths per capita than neighbouring Norway or Finland. Then came contempt for emotions, mixed with misogyny. Lena Einhorn, one of the 22 critics, was interviewed via videolink from her home. She broached research reports and numbers, but influential columnists focused on making fun of her hair or curtains. Her hysterical voice when describing the suffering of Covid-19 patients was also widely mocked. The detached response to her by chief epidemiologist Tegnell was hailed as evidence of his credibility. It is true that he speaks clinically about death in terms of statistical curves. But it is equally true that he did not offer much rebuttal of the research reports she quoted. From this trope of Sweden being alone in doing it right, we seem now to have shifted to denying that Sweden is doing anything exceptional at all. An opinion piece by a political scientist suggested that the Guardian had blacklisted Sweden, and that its reporting had described Sweden as free from restrictions. Who would have thought Trumps fake news would one day turn out to be somewhat real? he concluded. But these claims are themselves untrue. The Guardian among others rightly reported the comparatively mild restrictions in Sweden. Nor was it fake news when Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Swedish doctors could soon be denying respirators to patients over the age of 80, and even those as young as 60 with underlying health conditions. In fact, this is now taking place. The public veneration for Tegnell has gone far beyond trust. He has become an icon, his face appearing on tattoos and baby garments. Writers otherwise known to cringe at any sign of nationalism describe him as the incarnation of Swedens soul. He should be named Swede of the year, says the former minister of public health. Serious newspapers run hagiographic stories on Tegnell and the general director of the public health agency, Johan Carlson. Pictures of their head offices flooded with flowers sent by private citizens are included.   Related: This is Europe: stay close with the Guardians email updates   Some failures of the Swedish model have been acknowledged. But they are often linked to the lack of compliance of immigrants. Former chief epidemiologist Johan Giesecke explains the failure to protect the elderly in nursing homes with reference to asylum seekers and refugees on the staff, who may not always be understanding the information. This has met with silence, if not approval. It may already have been picked up by the Sweden Democrats, Swedens anti-immigration party, who now claim the health of elderly people has been put at risk for the sake of integrating uneducated immigrants. Defenders of the governments strategy keep repeating that it is too early to evaluate it. But carrying that argument through to its logical conclusion suggests that veneration should also be postponed until the pandemic has passed. Any successful strategy should be transparent and welcome public scrutiny. My fear is that in our vehement defence of the Swedish approach, we have released forces we cannot control. As is clear for anyone who has followed Brexit, a nationalism unable to handle criticism can easily tear a society apart.

 10.15am BST 

Well conclude our Australian rolling coverage of Covid-19 developments here. Thank you for your company and correspondence, commendations and criticisms, all of it a welcome and vital part of our communitys discussion.
Be well, and stay safe.
Tonight in Australia:

6,767 cases have been recorded in Australia after 14 new cases in the past 24 hours.
1,022 are still active cases, 83 people are in hospital, with 28 in intensive care.
South Australia has had no new cases for nine days, Queensland for five.
The death toll is 93  NSW 43, Victoria 18, Tasmania 13, WA eight, Queensland four, SA four, ACT three.
Twenty-one of the deaths were among passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, four were on the Artania in WA and 13 were residents at the Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney.
More than 3.5 million people have registered with the federal governments tracking app Covidsafe since Sunday.

On restrictions, closures and suppression measures:

National cabinet will decide on relaxing some social and economic clamps next Friday, a week earlier than expected.
Australias borders wont reopen for at least three months, the federal government says.
More than 340,000 businesses have received a cashflow boost worth over $6bn
Aged care providers will get $205 million to help keep homes open to visitors through extra screening staff and protective equipment.
More than 1.5 million people are on jobseeker, with 900,000 claims processed in the past six weeks.
In NSW from midnight Friday, households will be allowed two adult visitors, and their children, under an initial easing of self-isolation measures. Most beaches are open for exercise, swimming and surfing only.
In WA, up to 10 people are able to gather for non-contact recreational activities and outdoor personal training, while open homes and display villages will also be permitted.
In Queensland, some stay-at-home restrictions will be eased on Saturday, allowing people to travel 50km from their residence to visit parks, have picnics and jet ski. Shopping for non-essential items will also be permitted.
The Northern Territory is implementing a three-stage easing of restrictions starting with reopening parks and allowing people to golf, fish and swim with others from May 1 before restaurants and bars reopen with a two-hour limit on May 15. Bans on entertainment venues will be lifted in the third stage.
Tasmania will on Monday ease restrictions in the states northwest which forced retailers and schools to stay closed.

Victoria will launch a website showcasing live music and comedy performances on Sunday with creators given access to $2.35 million in grants.
NSW students will attend school one day a week starting from May 11. Queensland will on May 15 review keeping children at home. No change has been flagged in Victoria. Western Australia hopes all students will return to classes by May 11 while 63 per cent of students have gone back in SA.
Still open: supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, public transport, some schools, hairdressers, petrol stations, postal and freight services, bottle shops, newsagents, retail shops. Restaurants restricted to takeaway and delivery in most states.

In other developments:

Five Australian hospitals will receive the experimental drug remdesivir from US pharmaceutical company Gilead.

And to the Northern Territory:
The Northern Territory government insists its health system is prepared for a potential second wave of coronavirus cases, as four defence force members with Covid-19 arrived from overseas.
The four returned from the Middle East on a routine Australian Defence Force flight that landed in Darwin early on Friday morning.
It occurred a day after Chief Minister Michael Gunner laid out his road map for winding back coronavirus restrictions in three stages over five weeks, with all businesses including restaurants, bars, cafes and gyms to reopen.
The NT had recorded no new cases of coronavirus since April 6, with only three of 28 people to test positive still recovering.
There have been no deaths or community transmission, with all cases related to travel, but a second wave of the virus is considered a high risk, especially if restrictions are removed too quickly.
The Australian Defence Force says it decided to test personnel after being notified that a number of locally engaged contractors had tested positive but did not say where the officers became infected..
The four were asymptomatic and taken to Royal Darwin hospital for assessment and placed in isolation.
A number of other people on that flight went into mandatory quarantine, NT Chief Health Officer Dr Hugh Heggie said.
A fifth ADF member who tested positive recently completed their deployment and returned to Australia and is currently in mandatory quarantine in Brisbane.
Defence will take all necessary measures in consultation with our coalition partners, relevant host nations and Australian federal, state and territory governments to ensure ADF personnel receive the treatment and care required, the ADF said in a statement.
The public were safe because everyone on that plane that landed on the Friday morning plane was in quarantine and not walking the streets or in shopping centres, NT Health Minister Natasha Fyles said.
Fyles said the health department had done acute care scenario testing to prepare for an outbreak of COVID-19, it had a pandemic plan, and a lot had been learnt when repatriated Australians from China and a cruise ship were quarantined in Darwin earlier this year.
NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said Territorians had been wonderful in their compliance with restrictions so far and urged them to remain vigilant and maintain measures, such as physical distancing, with parks starting to open this long weekend.

South Australia has enjoyed nine days of zero new Covid-19 cases. But the premier has warned against complacency, and lifting restrictions too early.
From AAP:
Talks of lifting South Australian coronavirus restrictions will begin in a weeks time but if done too early, could be a blow to the economy, the premier says.
Steven Marshall said restaurants, cafes and pubs could open to a bookings-only system where social distancing and good hygiene would remain in place when restrictions lifted.
We may need to go back to the proprietor of that restaurant to find out who was dining there on a certain night if we find out someone had been infected and was present there, so there will be modifications, the premier said on Friday.
He encouraged South Australians to participate in non-contact sports, such as tennis, golf and lawn bowls, so long as they coincided with current restrictions.
As long as youre not using the change rooms and facilities and keep the numbers under 10, were encouraging people to get out and play.
Marshall said more clarity around contact community and recreational sports could also be given from next Friday, now its been confirmed that decisions will be made by individual states or territories.
Decisions on elite sports that require crossing jurisdictions will be made at the national level.
We know sport is part of our psyche here in Australia but weve got to do it in a way which is safe, Marshall said.
We have to recognise that different jurisdictions are at different points along the curve in terms of the pandemic.
He said the cabinet will meet twice next week to further discuss the right way to incrementally lift restrictions.
Weve got one shot to get this right here in SA.
We didnt want to have this in-and-out orientation, releasing them and then putting them back in place a few weeks later.
It would have an enormous cost to the economy.
It comes as the state reported its ninth consecutive day of zero Covid-19 cases.
The states total remains at 438 with 97 per cent considered recovered.
There are no longer any patients in intensive care but three people remain hospitalised.
SA Pathology has conducted more than 58,000 tests since February and although the two-week blitz has finished, the testing remains open to anyone who has minor symptoms.

The major topic was, of course, Covid-19, the largest disruptive event the world has seen in many years.
The meeting reported that 3.5 million people in Australia have downloaded the Covidsafe app. 
Ministers acknowledged privacy concerns are still front and centre for many people when deciding whether to download the app and were an important consideration in the apps design.

The NSW government has released a statewide Covid-19 heat map, showing pandemic information by postcode. The map details the number of active cases, testing rates, and number of recovered cases in each local community.
This new way of showing NSW Health data will help communities understand the numbers of people being tested, and encourage more people with symptoms to come forward for testing when they see the impact COVID-19 is having on their local area, NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said. 
It also provides encouraging data showing how people are bouncing back from the virus.
Its accessible here.

Cholera has largely been beaten in the west, but it still kills tens of thousands of people in poorer countries every year. As we search for a cure for coronavirus, we have to make sure it will be available to everyone, not just to those in wealthy nations.
This is a fine piece by Dr Neil Singh.
For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.

He said the role of Defence in Australias Covid-19 response was critical, and I thank every Australian Defence Force member, their parents, partners and children for the patience, resilience, understanding and support they continue to provide so that we can continue to serve.
The ADF has established Operation Covid Assist, deploying military personnel within Australia to assist state and territory governments with contact tracing, planning and logistics, and working alongside police to enforce mandatory quarantine arrangements for international arrivals.
Five members of the Australian Defence Force have caught Covid-19 while serving in the Middle East.

In other news, if you, like me, are in Melbourne, you may have noticed that it is quite cold. Almost record-breakingly cold for the first of May, in fact, although the dial did just inch above 12C this afternoon.
There has been significant snowfall across the alpine resorts, which just a few months ago were on fire or close to it. The ski season doesnt officially start until next month so its possible coronavirus restrictions could by then be eased to allow some skiing.

Here are a few more details on that study on the potential spread of the coronavirus in schools, which the WA government announced earlier in partnership with the Telethon Kids Institute.
It will be conducted across 80 public schools, education support centres and residential colleges across WA, covering a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Participation in the study is voluntary, and requires the consent of both teachers and the parents of all children involved. That doesnt mean you have to give consent if your child attends one of the 80 schools, only if they specifically are part of the study.
The first part of the study involves surveillance testing of a sample of staff and students across 40 schools over three months, potentially longer depending on the number of cases detected. Parents will be advised of the outcome of tests and the tests used will be different to those at a Covid clinic. Itll be a less invasive swab.
That will start next week.
Any positive tests will be subject to contact tracing, and any close contacts identified will undergo multiple tests for Covid-19 at intervals over two weeks, irrespective of whether they show symptoms, a WA government statement said.
Close contacts will also be required to keep a diary during that period. This is intended to identify any onward transmission and provide a greater understanding of the role schools play in the transmissibility of Covid-19 between students and staff, and the wider community via household members and other non-school contacts.
The third part of the study is about the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic.

The difference in the NRL seems to be that they plan to keep players permanently quarantined, apart from games. Thats why Queensland has granted them a free pass through the border.

Queensland gives the NRL permission to restart the 2020 season

The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, says she had a phone conference following national cabinet with the NRL chairman, Peter VLandys, and the CEOs of the Broncos, Cowboys and Titans, and told them they could resume training for the season reopener on 28 May.
In a statement, Palaszczuk said:

I said I was as keen as anyone else to see the NRL return and I meant it.
The only condition was that it did not put our excellent work containing the spread of COVID-19 at risk and the Chief Health Officer advises that the NRL plan is workable.

She also demanded assurances that the NRL will enforce home quarantine, after reports of some players breaking restrictions this week. 
The decision means players have permission to travel across the Queensland border to play, effectively making them essential workers.

First round games will be played in Queensland and of course I put in a bid for a local grand final and we all look forward to hosting the State of Origin.

 7.20am BST 

Cook is outlining a plan for a study, which will be done with the Telethon Kids Institute, to monitor and track any transmission of Covid-19 in schools.
It will involve a random sample of staff and students who volunteer to be tested for Covid-19 over a period of three months. Any positive tests will be contact traced, and participants are required to keep a diary. The study will examine whether any of the transmission occurred at school. 
Cook says all available evidence indicates that schools are safe and our commitment to this study should provide the community further assurance that we are taking all available steps to ensure that schools are safe, and that any undetected spread at school is discovered.

And a clarification on that earlier figure re the number of tests. Cook says the WA figures related to the number of people tested (which to date is more than 41,000), not the number of tests done. 
Thats why WAs test figures could appear low compared to other states, because some states report the number of tests done and there can be multiple tests done per person.

The Western Australian health minister, Roger Cook, says WA has the highest rate of tests per community transmission of the virus. Which seems to be quite an esoteric way to measure it. 
Still, a high rate of testing.

Childcare providers not eligible for jobkeeper may get top-up payment

Just after Scott Morrisons press conference ended, the government announced another tweak to its childcare package to ease concerns about some services facing funding shortfalls. Under the temporary free childcare policy, parents are spared from paying any fees, but providers have been crunching the numbers and finding problems.
While the general funding under the relief package was intended to work together with the jobkeeper wage subsidy of $1,500 per worker per fortnight, some services do not meet the test for the payment and those that do qualify cannot claim it for some casuals or work visa holders.
The education minister, Dan Tehan, issued a statement this afternoon saying the government had expanded the eligibility for extra payments to childcare services that miss out on the jobkeeper wage subsidy.
It says:

Providers that are not eligible for the JobKeeper Payment, including non-government schools, large charities and not-for-profit organisations, will be eligible for a top-up payment.

Tehan said the government would also help family day care and in-home care providers that were not eligible for jobkeeper and apply for an ABN by 1 June.

Some more details on that one-off $205m payment to the aged care sector. Its intended to facilitate testing by ensuring centres have adequate staff.
The payment is linked to the number of residents at a facility. 
Providers will receive about $900 per resident in major metropolitan areas and $1,350 per resident everywhere else.

More details on the aged care code of conduct

The aged care Code of Conduct on Pandemic Procedures sets out the requirements for aged care centres to facilitate family visits. It can be viewed here. (This is the link the PMO provided, even though it says draft.)
It comes after the aged care sector received criticism for, in some cases, shutting down facilities and not allowing visitors even when no outbreak was present. When there is a Covid-19 outbreak, a lockdown is allowed but communication with family members and residents must be swift and extensive.
The code says that visits to residents should be short unless the person being visited is dying, or the resident has an established pattern of receiving visits that help in their care or support. 
When it comes to residents who are dying or in their final weeks, the code says, homes should be flexible with regards to the number of visitors at any one time and the length and frequency of visits. 

Erring on the side of compassion is important, given the difficulty in predicting when a person is going to die.

Where visitors have an established pattern of always coming at a set time to help their loved one, for example coming to help with meals, the length, frequency, and nature of the visits should reflect what is needed for the person to be cared for appropriately and consistent with established practices and routines.

Sport principles show sport will remain spectator-free

The national principles for the resumption of sport and recreation activities are 15 points long, so I wont go through all of them. 
Point 13 is that sport, if resumed, will be spectator-free for the foreseeable future.
The principles say the resumption of sport will be based on objective health information and that while the Australian Institute of Sports Framework for Rebooting Sport in a Covid-19 Environment will provide a general guide the final decisions will be made by state and territory governments.
Other key points:

Outdoor activities are considered lower risk.
Community sporting activities involving 10 or fewer participants in a non contact fashion will be able to resume first before sport involving larger groups and full-contact sports. Physical distancing will have to be maintained. That will also apply to childrens sport.
Golf, fishing, bushwalking, swimming etc will also be required to stick to physical distancing rules.
 Significantly enhanced risk mitigation must be applied to all indoor activities associated with outdoor sorts. So no shaking hands in the change rooms.
The AIS framework is the minimum baseline standard required to be met before the resumption of training or match play of professional sports.
Sports seeking specific exemptions must seek approvals from the relevant state or territory governments, or local public health authorities.
At all times, sporting organisations must respond to the directives of public health authorities, including if ordered quarantine of a whole team or large group, and close contacts, for the required period.
For the foreseeable future, elite sports, if recommenced, should do so in a spectator-free environment with the minimum support staff available to support the competition.

ACT eases restrictions  slightly

The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has announced a very slight easing of restrictions. The definition of household units will be expanded/clarified to include children. Household units will now be allowed to visit each other, so adult children can visit their parents.
Barr described this measure as a down payment on further changes to be announced next week, which he hints will include an easing of restrictions on the number of people allowed to congregate together outdoors.
Barr also issued advice that non-essential retail is also allowed, like buying a winter coat before winter.
Barr warned Australia has still got a long way to go and its more a matter of when further outbreaks occur rather than if they do.
The one race I am happy weve won [in the ACT]  is we have no active cases.

So, what did we learn from that press conference?
Well, not as much as we may have expected.
We know that the national cabinet has brought forward its decision on whether to ease those baseline shutdown provisions to next Friday 8 May. Previously the deadline was 11 May. Downloading the CovidSafe app is not mandatory, but Morrison says the number of downloads will be one of the factors considered. He will not say how many people need to have downloaded it, but suggests there need to be many more downloads for national cabinet to be comfortable with its ability to improve contact tracing. So: app not mandatory but strongly encouraged, particularly if you want to go back to the pub or play sport.

On sport, a set of principles has been agreed to on allowing the resumption of professional and community sport, but no decisions have actually been made. Those decisions will be made next week.
The biggest aged care providers have also signed on to a new industry code of conduct on managing the coronavirus, and the federal government has agreed to give them a one-off payment of $205m.
And the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Australia will begin testing cohorts of asymptomatic people in an attempt to ensure early detection of any new outbreaks and avoid a second wave. That cluster testing will be focused on groups that have a high risk of exposure or work with vulnerable people, like aged care workers or healthcare workers. Teachers are among those who might get tested. 
Anyone with any respiratory symptoms at all  a cough, runny nose, anything  is now encouraged to get tested for Covid-19 and to avoid work.

Scott Morrison is asked to comment on Donald Trumps claim to have evidence to substantiate a theory that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Trumps comment was made despite US intelligence agencies concluding that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified.
Morrison says he has not seen any evidence to suggest thats the case, but says Australia is still pushing for an independent investigation into the origin of the disease. 

What we have before us doesnt suggest that that is the likely source. Theres nothing that we have that would suggest that that is the likely source, but you cant rule anything out in this scenario.

He says the virus did originate in Wuhan, but the most likely scenario that has been canvassed related to wildlife wet markets.
That is why Australia wants an objective independent investigation, he says.

While that cant be ruled out, its not something we have seen any hard evidence of that that is the position.

A reporter asks if the easing of restrictions next week is contingent on more people downloading the CovidSafe app. Morrison says it is. 
He says if you want to go to the pub, you have to download the app.

Now if that isnt an incentive for Australians to download CovidSafe on a Friday, I dont know what is ... that is a prerequisite to even getting to that conversation.

There will not be any additional restrictions.

We havent been considering additional restrictions, we have been out of that mode for some weeks ... but the degree, honestly, to which we can consider easing the restrictions we have now, that depends on how many people have downloaded the CovidSafe app. It really does.

More detail on restarting sport

Morrison says the principles agreed to for restarting sport and recreational activities are based heavily on the Australian Institute of Sports plan.
He says national cabinet has not made a decision on when and in what way sport can resume. That will be made next week.
Among the principles are that outdoor activities are lower risk, and that there should be a staged resumption of sport. Possibly with smaller groups, less than 10 people in a non-contact sport, being allowed out first. 
Again, no decisions made yet:

Decisions have not been taken to move on any of those matters but these principles set out the basis upon which we might be able to go forward when we set that out next week.

Richard Colbeck is also the minister for sport. He says the return will be staged. We are currently in stage A  no sport. The next stage is stage B  outdoor, non-contact sports in groups of 10 or less. Then its stage C  all sport. He makes another plug for the app

If you want to get out to play, download the app today.

Brendan Murphy defends Victoria's deputy chief health officer

Both Scott Morrison and Brendan Murphy are asked for their opinion on Victorias deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, making a tweet. The state opposition has called for her to resign and reported her to Victorias public health commission. 
Morrison made some remarks on that earlier, and said he wont comment further.
Murphy defended van Diemens ability to do her job.

A question on how people living in densely populated areas should deal with the easing of restrictions.
Journalist: People are told dont do a Bondi. What if people go down to the beach and see its really busy. Do they go home?
Morrison says people need to exercise commonsense. Physical distancing, the requirement to remain 1.5 metres apart, will not lift when the restrictions lift.

Those things would always have to be practised. So long as the coronavirus is out there then that is your best defence against it. 

Morrison says people should be motivated by their own desire not to get sick.

I think people will be able to exercise judgment in their own self-interest. People walking into a crowded room ... will be putting their health at risk.

Murphy:

Whilst we are living with this virus the way that we interact with each other will have to be different and will remain different.

Murphy is asked if the cohort testing of asymptomatic people will include testing of schoolchildren. He says no, but it will include testing of teachers.

What about the NRL?
Morrison says its a matter for state jurisdictions to clear or not clear any particular sporting codes. But the health advice to the states will be consistent and provided by the AHPPC. 
So each state should be saying the same thing to each code.
In relation to the New Zealand Warriors being given permission to travel, Morrison says no amount of reporting will change that outcome. It has been received and is being considered.

Will employers be requiring people to download the app, or will the government require businesses to require employees to download the app, before restrictions are lifted?
Morrison says it cannot be required under law but we are encouraging it.

Its done on the basis of encouragement in the national public health interest and I have to say in the national economic interest. It is our path back to download the CovidSafe app.


Updated at 5.42am BST

To questions. I think Morrison just suggested he will try out Barre class, which is a joke that has run the length of this lockdown period and proved that we truly are starved for information.

'We need to test more people'

Murphy is outlining the plan to ensure enough testing is done to detect any possible second wave of coronavirus. Australia will do cohort testing, identifying particular groups and testing asymptomatic people to ensure the virus isnt undetected. Those cohorts include aged care workers, healthcare workers and hospital patients. (If they consent, of course.)
Says Murphy:

We need to test more people. If we are going to get on top of those small outbreaks ... we cannot afford to have an outbreak that takes off so that we get a second wave when we reduce restrictions such as a number of other countries have seen. So our testing has to be very good.

He says that the case data shows that most people who transmit the virus do still have symptoms, so anyone with any symptoms should get tested. 

The most important thing in testing is for anyone who has respiratory symptoms, a cough or a cold or a sore throat, to get tested ... get tested and dont go to work.

Murphy says Australia has beaten the modelling in terms of the number of new cases of Covid-19 reported.

Pretty convincingly we have flattened the curve. 

There are now only two states on the graph showing the effective reproduction number. Last week the ACT and NT had dropped off the graph, because their case numbers were so low.

The case numbers in every other jurisdiction are so small that the models feel that they cant effectively use the effective reproduction number ... only in NSW and Tasmania are there enough numbers to show an effective reproduction number.

Brendan Murphy is going through the requirements that need to be in place before restrictions can be eased.
Australia now has enough testing kits and a secure supply line. We have enough masks and a good supply line, and the supply line for other PPE is being restored.
The public health workforce needed to be ready to respond to an outbreak. Murphy says Australia has excelled in that space. 

Every state and territory now expanded so much in the very active stage of the outbreak that they are now able to stand down some of the workforce but they are there and ready to be active if we need them again.

Murphy says that the requirement for improved contact tracing was almost there, accept for the app uptake. 

We need the app uptake to be higher before we can say that that final piece in the jigsaw puzzle of contact tracing is there.

Industry signs up to aged care code of conduct

The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, says all the major aged care providers, including Anglicare and BaptistCare, signed up to the new aged care code last night.
It sets out rules and rights for people visiting their loved ones at the end of their life, and people who are used to receiving regular visitation as part of their care, such as dementia patients.
Colbeck says only 23 residential aged care homes have had an outbreak of Covid-19 in Australia. (Weird use of only.)
Fifteen of those residential aged care centres have now cleared the infection and in eight it is ongoing. Colbeck says most centres had only two or three residents with an infection.
Among those who have now been declared Covid-free are Dorothy Henderson Lodge, the first aged care home to have an outbreak. At least six residents of that aged care facility died after testing positive to Covid-19.

The 17-year-old girl tried to enter the Blacktown station on 23 April while smoking a cigarette before a male staffer approached to say smoking wasnt allowed, NSW police said in a statement on Friday, according to AAP.
She allegedly spat on the 56-year-old mans face and said: I have Covid.
A 16-year-old teenage boy, who is known to the girl, then ran over and coughed and spat in the staff members face, police said.
A 53-year-old female Sydney Trains employee intervened and was allegedly punched in the head.
The two teenagers then fled the scene, police said.
They were arrested at a home in Pendle Hill on Thursday and the girl was charged with smoking in a public area and not complying with a Covid-19 direction on spitting and coughing.

Through no fault of their own, many of the more than 310,000 higher education students living and studying in Australia have lost their part-time jobs.
They are not eligible for the same support local students can get through jobkeeper and jobseeker.
To date, the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australian, Tasmanian, Victoria and Western Australian governments have announced assistance packages for international students. Some support has also been offered at the Federal level.

Jackson said a nationally consistent approach to this challenge is vital. 

Universities Australia is ready to work with all governments on developing sustainable, ongoing assistance that international students will require beyond the short-term.

Ratings agency S&P has downgraded stricken airline Virgin to D, the lowest grade possible, after the companys administrators got payments on its planes frozen for a month and applied for protection from its US creditors.
As Guardian Australia reported, the administrators  partners at Deloitte  have asked a court in the US to protect them from claims there by American creditors owed billions of dollars and prevent four planes that are being repaired in Nashville from being seized. D  for default  is the lowest credit rating S&P can hand out. 
The agency said in a note: 

We expect that unsecured lenders will be forced to accept less value for amounts owing under the terms of the existing unsecured debt facilities as part of the anticipated debt restructuring and recapitalisation process.

As Guardian Australia has reported, unsecured lenders who took a punt on Virgin in return for high interest rates are likely to take a hefty haircut. Estimates of what theyll get vary from a pessimistic 7c in the dollar to a rather optimistic 65c.

PM calls Twiggy Forrests comments on coronavirus origin 'nonsense'

Scott Morrison has described some of mining billionaire Andrew Twiggy Forrests comments as nonsense on 2GB radio today. 
The mining magnate had said, on a podcast by the West Australian newspaper a month ago, that the virus could have originated in a country other than China. It just might be Australia, it just might be Britain, it just might be China, he said on 2 April.
Today, Morrison was asked about these comments on radio after Forrest brought Chinas Victorian consul general to a government press conference yesterday. The prime minister said:

Thats obviously nonsense. I dont think anybody is in any fantasyland about where it started  it started in China.
It started in China. That is not a statement of accusation or criticism, its just a statement of fact.

Yesterday, Forrest invited consul general Long Zhou to a presser with the health minister, Greg Hunt, without Hunts knowledge. 
The mining magnate then told commentators to take a chill pill over the uproar.
He described it as the biggest non-story ever.

Im the most Australian person I know. Take a chill pill.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released new data on the impact of Covid-19 on household finances, finding that nearly half (45%) of Australians aged over 18 years have been impacted.
The results are:

A third of Australians (31%) reported that their household finances had worsened over this period, while one in seven (14%) reported an improvement.
The majority of Australians (81%) said their household could raise $2,000 for something important within a week, lower than the 84% reported in 2014.
One in 13 Australians (7.5%) said their household lacked the money to pay one or more bills on time, and one in 10 (10%) had to draw on accumulated savings to support basic living expenses.

It seems the Covid-19 economic supports might be part of the reason people are mostly still able to pay their bills:

A quarter of Australians aged 18 years and over (28%) said they received the first one-off $750 economic support payment, announced by the commonwealth government in March.
Those aged 65 years and over were more likely than those aged 18 to 64 to have received the first one-off $750 economic support payment (60% compared with 19%).

The Queensland Coalition MP Andrew Laming has asked people to call the police on teachers if they do not let their children attend school. 
Laming, the federal MP for Bowman in Brisbane, posted the message in a video on Facebook yesterday. 
He said vulnerable students from poorer families were falling behind, AAP reports.

Please, pick up your enrolment forms, hold them above your head, march into school, drop your kids off, and if they try and prevent those kids from going to school, call the police. 
This is witchcraft. We are back in the Middle Ages with these unions.

In Queensland, schools are currently open but only for the children of essential workers and vulnerable families. The government will re-evaluate that on 15 May.
Queenslands state education minister, Grace Grace, said Lamings statements were a little bit idiotic. She told AAP:

This is from someone who Im starting to think is acting a little bit idiotic and it is quite ridiculous. Every single school in Australia and around the world is impacted by this pandemic. 
So these outrageous claims, calling unnecessary anxiety and causing stress amongst our principals and teachers, are simply ridiculous.

Exclusive: Five Australian hospitals to receive experimental drug remdesivir

My colleague Melissa Davey has the exclusive story that negotiations are underway to supply five Australian hospitals with the experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir:

The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental Covid-19 drug remdesivir.
The only confirmed location is St Vincents hospital in Sydney ... A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the health department has been engaging with Gilead on gaining access to the drug for Covid-19 patients.
The news comes as the doctor informing the Covid-19 response in the White House, the immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, promoted preliminary findings from a joint Gilead and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that suggested remdesivir could improve recovery time of patients. His comments have revived global hope in the drug, with no treatments now available for the virus.
But experts have warned that the study findings are unpublished and preliminary.

Tasmania will lift its strict north-west lockdown on Monday

Tasmanias premier, Peter Gutwein, has just announced that the additional restrictions imposed on the states north-west will be lifted by Monday. 
Additional restrictions had been placed on the region due to a coronavirus cluster among health workers, which was traced to the Ruby Princess cruise ship.
Up to 5,000 people who were healthcare workers and their families were placed under quarantine, and non-essential businesses and shops were banned. 
But on Friday Gutwein said these severe restrictions will be lifted, though the entire state would continue to have its existing restrictions. 
We are confident that those additional restrictions, placed on the north-west on Sunday almost three weeks ago, the 12 April, will be able to lift, he said.
Meaning on Monday the fourth of May, the businesses and services which were impacted by those additional restrictions can reopen, and the workers and staff will be able to return to work.
Its important to note this will only be the lifting of the additional restrictions. The statewide restrictions in place in terms of personal movement, the operation of certain businesses, will still apply.
The north-west outbreak has been linked to 11 deaths so far.

Queensland records zero new cases

Queenslands health minister, Stephen Miles, has announced there have been no new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours as the state gears up to ease restrictions at the weekend. 
That means there have only been eight cases in the state this week. 
But Miles warned Queenslanders to still keep a 1.5-metre distance from other people, and not to become complacent.
Our message today is, this weekend, as we ease those restrictions, lets not mess it up, he said. Lets keep it up. Lets keep getting the zero results.
The states chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said Queensland could then see more restrictions lifted in future. 
But that will depend on the weekend. 
Well immediately get feedback about what people have done, she said. If we see large gatherings in places, that would concern us greatly and well have to rethink.
But she says there was no reason for transmission to increase under the new rules, because people were supposed to only be primarily with their household.

Daniel Andrews is speaking now. 
The Victorian premier says the state will consider options we will have to potentially ease [restrictions] in the lead-up to 11 May.
But he asks people to continue staying at home for now, even as other states ease restrictions, because Victoria has had a higher rate of community transmission than other states:

 We have come too far, we have achieved too much for us to give that back, for us to fritter that hard work away.


I know it is easy to think that well, with such low case numbers maybe the worst has passed, maybe this is over, I just want to remind every Victorian this is very, very fragile, we saw a spike in numbers just a couple of days ago, we have had outbreaks in lots of different settings.


We have also had significant community transmission in Victoria as well. About 10% of our cases we cant track them back to an overseas traveller. Not every state is like that. Some states have no community transmission at all.

He also calls on Victorians to get tested for mildest symptoms and says the state has ramped up testing:

The more tests we can get done in the lead-up to 11 May, the more options we will have to potentially ease some of the rules that I know are frustrating.

Please come forward even if you have the mildest symptoms, she said. You dont need to wait until Monday. You could be unintentionally passing on the disease without knowing you have it.
NSWs chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said three of the nine new cases were residents at Anglicares Newmarch House aged care home, four were community transmission cases and one was under investigation. 
She also confirmed that the resident who died at Newmarch House yesterday was a 74-year-old man.

In Queensland, from Saturday: 

You will be allowed to go for picnics and non-essential drives, and national parks will reopen, but you are not allowed to travel more than 50km from your home.
You can shop for non-essential items.
The two-person person rule is still in effect, meaning that you can only be joined by one other person who isnt in your household  and still keep physically distant. Previously, Annastacia Palaszczuk said people inside a home were allowed two additional guests.
The Queensland border remains closed unless you are a resident or essential worker. 

In NSW, from today: 

Two adults and the children in their care are allowed to visit another persons home, for any reason.
You still have to comply with physical distancing  which means keeping apart, avoiding unnecessary contact and not crowding small spaces. 
There are no limits on how many guests someone is allowed a day as long as there are no more than two adults at a time. 

In WA, since Monday: 

Gathering limits increased from two people to 10.
People are allowed to leave home for recreational activities including picnics, fishing, boating and camping. 
Maximum number of people at a wedding raised from five to 10.
Border restrictions remain in place.

"2020-05-01T09:30:20Z","lifeandstyle","Life and style","Quarantine is perfect for discovering the beauty and power of boredom","Every morning these days, I challenge myself to fill the kettle and then stand at the stove  and wait until it boils. For the first month of quarantine, those four precious minutes between clicking on the gas to hearing the urgent whistle were my chance to run around the house, make sure the kids computers were charged for another day of remote learning, and quickly transfer the next load of laundry from washer to dryer. Now, Im trying to embrace every opportunity, modest as they may be, to get well and truly bored.   Related: Bargaining! Boredom! Screens! Its the full spectrum of coronavirus feelings | First Dog on the Moon   Quarantines have meant different things for people. It exhausts some as they spin from remote work to remote school and checking in on friends and family, all amid the miasma of disease and dashed dreams. Others are exhausted by vast stretches of open time, cornered at home with nothing to do but binge movies, scroll through Instagram and agonize. Some may crave solitude; others are suffocating in it. All this monotony is, for many of us, incredibly boring. But please dont wish away your boredom. Despite its bad reputation, boredom is secretly powerful and quite wonderful. I began studying boredom six years ago during a creative dry spell. I was struggling to come up with ideas for my podcast. The feeling was more disturbing than my usual writers block, like sand filling my cranium. I responded with a pavlovian impulse to be productive. Every empty crack in my day was filled. Instead of staring at peoples feet on the subway, I attacked my inbox. Why wait idly for the barista to make my coffee when I could check the headlines or how many steps I walked? It was then that I realized this mental state itself was worthy of consideration, maybe even worth indulging. I decided to find what happens in our brains when we allow ourselves to get bored  when we just stand by the swings as our child goes back and forth for the hundredth time and dont text someone. I wasnt sure I could even manage to do that any more. But perhaps I should. Because what if the human condition of boredom actually has a purpose? The cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists I interviewed explained that when boredom strikes and our minds begin to wander, we ignite the default mode of our brain: a neural network where our most original ideas and problem solving happens. This neural network, discovered by neuroscientist Marcus Raichle 20 years ago, kicks into gear when we arent focused on a specific external task. Think of it this way. When you first get into the shower, youre attentive, concentrating on getting the water temperature right and locating the shampoo. But once youve scrubbed your scalp, the water lulls you  and your mind drifts away  into the default mode. Though youre ostensibly doing nothing, or seemingly mesmerized by a patch of grout, this is when the mental magic begins. Perhaps its on a small scale, like if you come up with an amazing way to sneak vegetables into your childs meal. Or, it can be on a much grander scale, like if a biochemical researcher has a eureka moment in the shower and figures out a new way to save lives. Beyond presenting us with ideas, the brains default mode also facilitates a process called autobiographical planning, a neuroscientific term which refers to what our mind does when we daydream. Lying there, staring at the ceiling, we think back to high and low moments in our lives, take note of the good and bad times, and tell ourselves the story of  ourselves. Our personal narrative. We imagine the future, visualize ourselves in new situations, set personal goals and then concoct strategies. Think of the default mode as a time machine in your brain with which you visit your past and future personhood. After learning all this I began the Bored and Brilliant Project (and later wrote a book by the same name) for my podcast Note to Self, drawing 20,000 listeners all eager to see how being bored more often might change them.    Deleting a social media app can feel like waking from a mental hibernation. Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA   My favorite moment was when we all, simultaneously, deleted the app that we felt compelled to incessantly tap to relieve boredom instead of simply experiencing it. I feel like Im waking up from a mental hibernation, one listener wrote. I pick up my guitar more, sleep better. Other stories included people who helped their child make friends at school, solved office conflicts, found ways to finish a doctoral thesis, and started a new business. One listener, Liam, removed every single social media app from his phone. He described the feeling of seeing no new notifications on his phone as a kind of embarrassing emotional experience, but, he said, I like not giving my phone the power to decide that for me. So thank you. Boredom isnt all great. It has been found to trigger some unpleasant thought patterns, including rumination  going round and round in your head about mistakes or fears. Too much mind wandering can lead to anxiety or depression. Theres a lot we dont know about how boredom works.  Still, Ive been hearing from a small but vocal contingent of people who are teaching themselves to embrace boredom while in quarantine.  My boredom has led me to searching for my passion, wrote one. I am reading more and am more focused than ever. Startlingly, some young people have told me that theyve never experienced boredom. One even said,  I dont think I could get bored because I cant be alone with myself. Quarantine grants us a gift: time. Time to clear out the dishwasher slowly. Time to go for a (socially distanced) walk without listening to anything. Time to lie on the ground while your child builds a fort around your head. We need to use this time wisely, embrace this uncontrollable ambiguity and reset our relationship to longer-term thinking. In meditation, were told to let our thoughts waft away. But when with boredom, I suggest you watch those thoughts carefully. See where they lead you. Dont worry if you feel like youre not doing it right. It can take time to pass through the uncomfortable side of boredom and into the empowering part. You might find embracing boredom jumpstarts your creativity too or, at the very least, relieves you from feeling any guilt about spending an afternoon on the couch doing nothing. Youre actually being productive  and just might change your life.","1082"
"2020-05-01T09:25:20Z","food","Food","Lockdown feels as if I’ve gone on a bad holiday to a one-star resort with only one restaurant","It was time to dispose of the aubergine. The one I acquired 39 days ago. Once firm, noble-seeming and purple, it now sat there looking forlorn  mottled in places, with a slightly jammy undercarriage. I picked it up several times on Tuesday and edged it closer to the bin, but I couldnt bring myself to make the final push: chucking food would be an admission of defeat. This decaying, bulbous lump was symbolic, I realised. It meant I couldnt just meal-plan and to-do list my way out of this mess. Covid-19 would still be here, causing havoc, at every level of my existence, whether I made soup out of mulchy salad leaves or raita from on-the-turn yoghurt. And, by God, Ive been good and compliant and jolly resourceful for six entire weeks by now, eating rotting things that I didnt quite fancy. Remember the banana bread stage? These were the same bananas still, just all hot and mushy now, but with one in the eye for the grim reaper. Ive been saintly about food waste, avoided supermarkets, protected the NHS and not frittered money on Deliveroo, but, to be quite honest, it no longer really feels like winning. The aubergine needed to go. This must be how Elizabeth I felt while signing Marys death warrant, I thought, quite reasonably. This is the sort of inner monologue you have in total self-isolation, cooking for yourself and seeing no one, for more than a month. By June, this column will be mainly hieroglyphics and links to YouTube clips of static. Over the past six weeks, as restaurants shut up shop, the industry has grappled to work out if well ever need chefs again. And at first I thought perhaps not - lets all just stew our own aubergines. But now I know well always need these people with their pans, stamina and imagination. All as barmy as a box of frogs, by the way (and I know a lot of chefs), but thats all part of their charm. And eating my own home cooking, and only home cooking, has proved to me that life feels oddly flat when you remove other peoples flights of fancy. I am well fed right now, and I am nourished. I am fortunate, too. But I also feel as if Ive gone by accident on a bad holiday, to a very remote, one-star TripAdvisor resort with only one restaurant, whose chef is diligent and well-meaning, but limited. Three weeks ago, I stopped bothering to shower for dinner because everything in every terrine  from the porridge to the pasta, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner  tasted oddly similar. Also, at 5pm daily, after the cha-cha lessons, they read out the latest death toll, but now Im just quibbling. And in that light, Deliverood vermicelli noodles and silver cartons packed full of battered stuff in bright neon, orange sauces begin to feel like a weird lifeline. I click on the web page, dawdling tantilisingly over the open now section. Dare I? Yes, I dare. Regardless where this virus leads us, there will in this weird new world definitely be a place for being cared for by others. And for that kind of Cantonese food that makes actual Cantonese people pinch the soft skin between their eyes in abject sadness, but that tastes fantastic as its forked directly into ones gullet. We need it as much as control and being good and dal-ing our own lentils and turning that aubergine into sodding ratatouille. In recent weeks, Ive craved burgers seasoned with, well, I dont quite know what. At some pub. Any pub. Its the chefs recipe, and hes not telling. Served in a fresh brioche bun. You know, one of those glossy buns that are frankly shocking for your weight, so I dont buy them to have at home. But, gosh, do I miss someone else, an anonymous source, supplying me with them. I miss someone else lacing my food with far too much oil, or butter, or salt, because Im just a stranger and they care little for my heart valves, but they want me to love their food and come back. I yearn for those anonymous figures, stood behind the stove, stirring good, freshly made pasta into silky sauces. I miss all the heat and light and extra happiness that you cant really pull off at home: the sear of a very hot grill, a judicious handful of MSG, a deep tandoori lustre and laksa noodles that have been cooked in several complex stages. But, until then, Ive got a bag of king edward potatoes with eyes and sprouts that need eating. Im too guilty to bin them, too. There is eating to live, and living to eat, and Ive learned which one I prefer.","797"
"2020-05-01T09:24:49Z","money","Money","Millions face 'financial cliff edge' due to Covid-19 crisis, says Citizens Advice","Millions of households have missed, or expect to miss, payments on at least one bill as a result of the coronavirus crisis, and could face serious consequences as a result, the charity Citizens Advice has said. Since the lockdown started, millions of workers have been furloughed or laid off by employers, and seen their pay fall as a result. Measures have been put in place to allow borrowers payment holidays and stall evictions, but the charity said that after these protections are lifted, millions face a financial cliff edge. A survey of 2,016 people carried out for Citizens Advice found a quarter of respondents had missed, or expected to miss, a payment, and 20% had missed payments of rent, council tax or telecoms bills. Arrears in these payments can have the most severe consequences, the charity said, with eviction, bailiff action or disconnection possible. If the results are extrapolated across the rest of the population, Citizens Advice said 11 million people could face problems when protections put in place during the crisis end. Property possessions and face-to-face bailiff recovery have been paused, but these measures are not due to continue beyond June. The survey found that people facing the greatest health risk from coronavirus were three times more likely to have fallen behind on a bill than average, and that the figure was the same among those in insecure work, such as agency workers and those on zero-hours contracts. Those aged under 40 were four times as likely to have missed payments as those over 40. The charity called on the government to fast-track the abolition of no-fault evictions and ensure tenants are given the chance to make up payments that they miss as a result of the crisis. It also wants councils to receive financial support to offer payment holidays to those struggling to meet council tax bills. Lucretia Thomas, a project adviser at Citizens Advice Enfield, said the pandemic had had a devastating effect on households, with some facing the threat of eviction from landlords. Many families that we see are in insecure employment and have lost income during the lockdown, she said. Theyre telling us that their household expenses have increased as they stay at home to reduce the spread of Covid-19 during this challenging time and beyond. Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said government measures had eased the financial burden for many households, but millions still have reason to fear the looming financial cliff edge when these protections end. She added: The government must take strong action to prevent millions going over the financial cliff edge, ensure people are helped out of debt, and so support the economic recovery.","447"
"2020-05-01T09:01:44Z","film","Film","My favourite film aged 12: The Notebook","Flash back to the summer of 2007: Spider-Man 3 was in theatres. Two of the top five most viewed YouTube videos were by the band My Chemical Romance. And The Notebook, a movie starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling as star-crossed teenage lovers who reconnect as adults, was three years old. The famous re-enactment of the films climactic lift-and-kiss at the MTV movie awards by its stars, then a real-life couple, was two years old. I was 13 years old and, true to sheltered oldest child form, didnt know about any of this. And so one sleepover night in my friends basement, I faced at least three aghast faces: You havent seen The Notebook?!? The Notebook probably has fans outside my demographic  its an adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance novel, a book/author/genre marketed to middle-aged women  but for girls in middle school (or, at least, my middle school in suburban Ohio) between 2004 and 2008 or so, it was a foundational text. It was the romantic movie of choice, a portal into couple-shipping YouTube and, later, Tumblr holes, a benchmark for years of unrealistic dating expectations. You wanted to know what sex was supposed to look and sound like AND tell everyone you bawled at the profound idea of love transcending old age? You watched The Notebook. For those who havent seen it, The Notebook follows 17-year-old Allie (McAdams) as she moves to a small South Carolina town for the summer and meets Noah (Gosling), a construction worker fond of Walt Whitman and bold gestures, such as threatening to jump off a ferris wheel to get Allie to go out with him. They fall in love, then break up (shes rich, hes not; her parents disapprove) and, separately, serve in the second world war . He pines for her; she gets engaged to handsome, preternaturally forgiving solider played by James Marsden. They reconnect, and things are complicated. The story is narrated by the older Noah, who reads from a notebook composed by Allie as a totem to bring her back from the dementia eclipsing her memories.    This twist  Noah and Allie have together composed an epic love story that she mostly cant remember  landed like a gut punch for us as emotionally chaotic seventh-graders who had imagined our sunset years approximately zero times. All of us watching that summer night ended the movie in tears, which was a cathartic bonding experience on its own. But at 13, on the cusp of high school but seemingly, for me, light-years away from sneaking out with a boy, the main draw was the heat between McAdams and Gosling. Their chemistry was palpable and hungry with a sharp, heady sting. (It is transparent they were falling in love off-screen.) These two were brain-meltingly hot, an unknowing factory of aspirational summer love gifs. Importantly for me then, the film hinges on one pivotal, rain-soaked scene in which Allie asks Noah why he never wrote her when they broke up. (Actually, he wrote her 365 letters! He wrote her every day for a year!). He proclaims, famously: It wasnt over  it STILL isnt over. At the time, I had no older friends or siblings, no health class, just the steamy handprint from Titanic, so I was thrilled when they kiss, and he pushes her against a wall, and carries her up the stairs, and strips off her soaked clothes  and the camera keeps rolling. As far as movies go, The Notebook has a rather tame sex scene  all soft lighting, swelling music, delicate shots that dont reveal much, nudity-wise. The camera mostly lingers on McAdams face as she has a transcendent time (again, disappointingly high expectations were set by this movie). The whole scene is only about 4.5 minutes long, but at 13 this felt like an eternity, and a guidebook. Oh, adulthood has this? You lose your senses and cant take your hands off someone? Good to know!    Rewatching The Notebook for the first time in years, its clear, of course, how silly it was to base my idea of maturity on this movie, and also how stellar McAdams and Goslings performances remain. The Notebook could have been a solid B-movie romance (see: every other Nicholas Sparks adaptation), but the lead performances power it far higher than its melodramatic parts. It is almost thrilling  and the main draw for me now  to watch two ascendant, now-acclaimed actors make the hairpin turns of its dialogue somewhat convincing. The idea of actually fighting this way? Laughable. But that look Noah gives Allie when he asks: Goddammit, what do you WANT? Yeah, that still hits. A couple of weeks ago, before this series assignment, I rewatched The Notebook on instinct. It felt good during, you know, ALL THIS, to return to an old favourite, to slip along the slick grooves of worn emotions. To retrace the lines of this familiar ride, even if I now find many of them horribly cheesy, and my feelings cringingly earnest. How to think of it now? I defer to Gosling, who said in that fateful year, 2007: God bless The Notebook. It introduced me to one of the great loves of my life. I would not classify The Notebook as one of my great loves, but still: god bless this movie, flawed textbook that it was, for introducing me to a new vision of the adult future, and for saying: Hang on. Its a bumpy ride of feelings ahead but one day, youll appreciate them.","916"

"2020-05-01T09:00:21Z","commentisfree","Opinion","Why can I visit a DIY shop but not a museum? This total lockdown is failing","A woman sits on a bench by the Thames. Two policemen arrive and tell her to stand up. Two boys remove their shirts in Holland Park. They are told to put them back on. A policeman shouts at two girls in bikinis on Primrose Hill to get dressed. How dare they enjoy themselves. You can crowd a London Tube train but not climb a Welsh mountain. You can drive to a country footpath, but only if the walk takes longer than the drive. Michael Gove will allow you out just for an hour. The trouble with official curbs on personal freedoms is that they degenerate into idiot authoritarianism. Rules become ever more pernickety, because their enforcers regard mere enjoyment as abuse. Goves directorate is like The Handmaids Tale, if not Oliver Cromwell. The latters blue laws similarly told women how to dress, and banned walks, pubs, plays, sports and the celebration of festivals. To unbridled power, the only lawful activity is one necessary to the security of the state. Is pleasure really unnecessary and happiness a menace? This weeks superb BBC Four documentary on Oxfords Young Rembrandt exhibition, narrated off-screen by Simon Schama, left me delighted but baffled. Why can I crowd Oxfords supermarkets but not its Ashmolean Museum? Why are people trusted to socially distance in a DIY shop but not in a garden centre or a National Trust park? My local hardware store can sell from its front door, but not my local pub. Only time will tell whose model of coronavirus was correct, and which governments means of combating it was most effective. Out of a sort of desperation, we have all become statistical nerds, and we strive to be objective. I remain on the side of the Swedes Johan Giesecke and Anders Tegnell (and Boris Johnson mark one), and against Britains Neil Ferguson (and Johnson mark two). The former seem to reflect common sense and behavioural science, the latter mathematical dogma and worst-case scenarios. Swedens deaths per million, at 244, are currently well behind Britains, at 384.   To unbridled power, the only lawful activity is one 'necessary' to the security of the state   I am equally drawn to the Oxford geographer Danny Dorlings intriguing research suggesting that coronavirus not only peaked in mid-April but appears to follow a similar trajectory everywhere, seemingly regardless of local policy and probably with similar fatality rates. The big difference will be in the collateral damage of their various forms of lockdown. As the Swedish scientists point out, this is a peculiar virus in that its overwhelming  though not most publicised  impact is in exacerbating existing illnesses in old people. This is 80-90% of deaths. Many are already locked down in care homes and hospitals. It would therefore make sense to direct all energy at protecting and trying to cure them. Yet while Britain was playing at The Handmaids Tale, it was leaving care homes to look after themselves, to an appalling extent in those known to me. For most other people  children, young people, even the middle aged  the risk of fatality, though tragic, is statistically minimal. Countries that have trusted people to observe voluntary distancing have not seen radically different fatalities from countries that have been draconian. Swedens victims have been overwhelmingly in already locked-down care homes, not in the general population. The same has been true in voluntarist Germany. I can accept that, with an unknown and lethal disease, some application of the precautionary principle should apply. But even then, it would make sense to relate lockdown to relative risk, if only to minimise harm to the nations wider, non-Covid-19-related, physical and mental health. One-size-fits-all lockdown abuses any concept of priority. Hence 18,000 possible extra cancer deaths are now predicted. Britains failure  unique in Europe - to involve its local government in lockdown decisions or remedial measures has clearly been a serious error. It delayed action on protective equipment, as well as on testing and chasing. To have to call in the army rather than use local councils and officials was crass. It will clearly impede the local easing of lockdown. I have still seen no good argument for keeping schools closed, just mindless Downing Street dogma. One size never fits all. Just as Covid-19 is selective, so surely can be the escape from it. The risk of infection is known to be greater in cities than elsewhere. So liberate the counties and countryside. The risk is greater indoors, so liberate outdoor trading. The risk is greater to the vulnerable old, so stop stifling the social and economic activities of the young. If you liberate high-risk Tube trains and supermarkets, why not low-risk playgrounds, public footpaths, pub gardens and local churches? If there really is a second peak  and there is always a risk  then we should be like Germany, and face it when it occurs. Meanwhile there is no question of a risk to lives and livelihoods in prolonging lockdown: that is a certainty. Britain has not been exceptional in much, except in its refusal to inform and debate with the public over lockdown. It has behaved like an old-fashioned centralist bureaucracy, with ministers and officials mouthing slogans and giving orders. What is the matter with the government? Why cant we sit on a bench?

Then I discovered sexual transmutation  the idea that you can harness your sexual energy to achieve goals. The practice is nothing new  it exists in Tantric and Taoist traditions. But I set about developing my own masturbation for manifestation method. My system combines the law of attraction (the belief that we attract into our lives whatever we focus on) with visualisation techniques and my own orgasmic energy. I set an intention, then stimulate myself sexually while I use my imagination to eroticise my aim. For instance, to manifest a new home, I might imagine myself inside it: my bare feet against the floor, naked on the new sofa and something erotic happening there. When I reach orgasm, the energy is released into the universe, where it begins to attract the ideal place. Some desires are easier to eroticise than others. Getting aroused while I thought about loan repayments was a challenge, but last summer I managed to become debt-free. I find masturbation with intention also takes a lot longer than when I was focused just on pleasure. This is a practice I reserve only for masturbation: when Im having sex with someone, Im focused on sharing an intimate moment. Thanks to my technique, I have manifested some incredible things, such as professional opportunities, holidays, even love. I hardly recognise my life now.

The setting was fairly familiar but the thrall of the language and the intensity of feeling gave a whole new meaning to life and introduced me to the alchemy and mystery of creativity. The book I wish Id writtenAny story by Anton Chekhov. The first Chekhov story I ever read was The Steppe. Books we most need come to us in a time of extremity. I read several pages of it in a cornfield in Ireland. My two sons were frisking about, my husband was silent and we had stopped to have tea from a flask, having just had a bitter parting from my family. I was on the point of leaving my husband but feared I would not have the courage or the means. Chekhovs story was that of a young boy being brought to a distant part of Russia to boarding school and though he was missing his mother, he was also observing everything around him and listening to the merchants droll conversations. He submerged his grief in the wonders all about him. What was uncanny for me was how convincing and immediate the story felt. I still have that edition with an inscription I wrote on the flyleaf, This story redeemed my sanity. It was dated September 1962. The book that influenced me A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway. He is a master of compression. The book I think is most underratedThe works of Rachel Carson.

I was in London working as an accountant and she was teaching in Paris. We decided we wanted more time together and an adventure. We packed up our lives and moved to Queenstown, New Zealand. Our time there was amazing: we worked in the day and spent evenings waterskiing, mountain running or barbecuing on the beach. At weekends, wed explore the South Island, but to do it properly you need a legendary vehicle, something that will just keep going. I found a knackered Toyota Land Cruiser for sale online. When we went to take a look, it turned out to be a neglected prison vehicle with a bird living inside, but it was only 6,000. We spent 18 months repairing it. Then every weekend wed chuck a mattress in the back and head off on escapades. After a few years, we decided to return to the UK and start building a more dependable life together. When it came time to say goodbye to New Zealand, we couldnt leave the car behind. We researched the 25,000-mile drive from New Zealand to Bristol in depth. It would take 10 months and no one would insure us. But when our families said, You cant, we thought, Why not?   Living out of a car together for 10 months felt like a bigger commitment than marriage  and we hadnt argued once   We set off on 16 February 2019 with a mattress, gas cooker, barbecue, two camping chairs, some clothes, a surfboard and a 50 daily budget for fuel and food. After a month on New Zealands North Island, we shipped the car to Malaysia and met it in Kuala Lumpur. From there, we drove across 22 countries: Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, by ferry to Italy, Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, France and Britain. As for the highlights  its hard to skip any part. Pakistans Passu Cones mountains in late summer provided the best view: Ive never seen mountains so high. And the two-week drive through northernmost Indias Himalayas, from Manali to Leh, was among the best stretches of road. The locals were friendliest in Pakistan. We were invited to a strangers 40th birthday and given the first slice of cake. Were still in touch over Facebook. Laos, with its limited tourist infrastructure, was the most rewarding adventure with great food. Wed have khao soy (noodle soup) for breakfast with a bucket of fresh juice. In Thailand, wed wake up with nothing between us and the sea but sand. Crossing the Pakistan-Iran border was the only hairy moment. Tourists are given an armed escort but, as we passed through a military base on the way to the border, the guards were tense and warned that the Taliban were in the area. We passed them several times as our escort yelled at me to keep driving. It was a terrifying half-hour before they dropped us off, but its the kind of experience that locals have daily.   Related: Experience: I am an Instagram husband   I serviced the car in most countries, every 3,000 miles. Those were some of my favourite moments.

I hadnt seen family for two years. Our friends threw a party at the pub, and I proposed to Romy. Living out of a car together for 10 months felt like a bigger commitment than marriage  and we hadnt argued once. She said yes. We loved how spontaneous our trip was: we would start each day not knowing where wed end up; pulling up at the first traffic lights, something or someone would set our whole day in motion. That cant last for ever. Were 30 and have been craving roots. We moved to Edinburgh in February. Im working as an accountant again and Romys a social worker, but theres unlimited potential for exploring here, hopefully with little ones one day. I love seeing the car parked on the driveway, knowing all the cool places it has been. Im proud of it. Sometimes Ill give it a kiss.

Related: Documents reveal FBI head defended encryption for WhatsApp before becoming fierce critic   Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California are encouraging tenants to withhold rent, whether they are able to pay or not, to draw attention to the plight of those unable to pay. The protest is expected to represent the largest coordinated rent strike in America in decades, and comes as the labor department announced another 3.8 million people lost their jobs last week, with pressure growing on state leaders nationwide to increase their efforts on housing. More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks, as the coronavirus has caused widespread business closures.   The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among those voicing support for the strikes, which are being coordinated by an array of housing groups. People arent striking because they dont feel like paying rent, theyre striking because they cant, Ocasio-Cortez said. In New York, more than 12,000 people have pledged to not pay their rent, and progressive state lawmakers have proposed legislation that would suspend or cancel rent payments for tenants who lost income due to the coronavirus. In March, New Yorks governor, Andrew Cuomo, suspended evictions for 90 days, in a move that prevents landlords from ousting tenants who cannot pay their rent. But critics say that merely postpones the problem. We need a suspension of rent and automatic forgiveness of any rent, mortgage or utility payment owed or accumulated during the length of this crisis, said Housing Justice for All, which campaigns to increase tenants rights and to end homelessness in New York. Like Cuomo, Governor Gavin Newsom of California has barred evictions due to coronavirus hardship  tenants must provide proof their income has been affected by the pandemic  but stopped short of waiving individuals rent payments. About 8,000 members of the Los Angeles Tenants Union are expected to withhold rent as of 1 May, while a similar movement is taking place in Philadelphia. If the estimates of New York City organizers prove accurate, the rent strike would be the largest there since the 1930s, when tenants in Harlem and the Lower East Side demanded lower rent. In Harlem, the protesters were predominantly African Americans, who protested against being charged higher rent than white tenants.","390"

But when the utility bills arrived last month, he knew there would be trouble. Haynes, 34, a construction worker from Newbern, Tennessee, was left without income after the governor issued a stay-at-home order in early April. As a cash-in-hand builder, he is not eligible to claim unemployment insurance, and the stimulus cheque still had not arrived. I always pay my bills on time, but without work, I just didnt have the money to cover everything, so I asked for an extension. They said no, Haynes said. Haynes, who lives with his wife and three children, managed to get the money just six days after the bill was due, but the city refused to accept the payment unless he also paid a $70 reconnection charge. He didnt have it, and the charge didnt make sense as they had not been disconnected. A few hours after his payment was turned down, the taps were turned off, even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged people to frequently wash their hands in order to prevent the virus spreading. For a week, the family survived on sodas and microwave meals, cleaning their hands with gel and flushing the toilet with buckets of water filled at a neighbours.   It is appalling that the federal government is still dragging its feet  Mary Grant, Food and Water Watch    In the end, Haynes returned to work despite the stay-at-home order so that he could get an advance on his wages to pay the reconnection fee. Its wrong what they did, especially with so many people out of work. I felt angry and embarrassed. Id never missed a bill before  I had no choice but to go back to work, he said. Haynes is among a rapidly growing number of working people faced with impossible economic and health tradeoffs during the coronavirus pandemic  which has so far left more than 61,000 Americans dead and 30 million unemployed. A third of American households  about 120 million people  still risk having their water disconnected and racking up exorbitant fees, despite calls from a coalition of lawmakers and advocates to suspend all utility shutoffs until the country drags itself out of this unprecedented crisis. And while more than 600 localities and 13 states have mandated moratoriums on disconnecting residents since early March, some of these will soon expire as states reopen for business. In Tennessee, where the energy burden is also very high, the governor has resisted calls for a statewide moratorium, claiming utility companies  like socially distancing residents  can be trusted to do the right thing.   Related: Millions in US at risk of 'water shutoffs' amid layoffs triggered by pandemic   So far, a handful of utilities serving 2.2 million, or 30% of Tennessee residents, have suspended shutoffs. None have agreed to reconnect households without running water despite the serious public health threat posed by poor hygiene. Deborah OBarr, 62, from Goodspring, has lived without running water since 2016. Its a complicated situation: she and her husband, Bobby, 63, who are both disabled, bought the house in a private sale, assuming it would be easy enough to get the water reconnected  it was shut off before they moved in because of unpaid bills. It was not reconnected, and for four years they have relied on a local spring and their son for water to cook with and drink, as well as rainwater for the toilet and cleaning. According to the local water departments rules, OBarr must prove that she is the legal homeowner, and then pay $1,050 for a new meter. But the deeds are still in the name of the previous owner, who is in prison on remand, and even if this could be resolved, OBarr says she doesnt have the money. It feels like nobody cares. We must be the lowest of the low as far as the water company is concerned. We just dont matter, not even during a pandemic, said OBarr.    Deborah and husband Bobby. Photograph: Deborah OBarr   They are not the only ones without tap water relying on wells and springs, according to Connie Gatlin, office manager for Minor Hill water utility district. [Mrs OBarr] has been aware of the utilitys rules and requirements since 2016. [Shes] waited for the pandemic to bring it up again. Its up to each [utility] board to decide about reconnections, thats what the governor said. We need a state moratorium [on shutoffs], said Brianna Knisley, of the advocacy group Appalachian Voices, who is concerned about the looming recession. The stay-at-home order expired on 30 April, but many people dont have jobs to go back to. Even before the current crisis, water affordability was a growing nationwide problem, after years of price hikes left an expanding number of low-income households struggling to pay bills. As a result, some public water utilities increased shutoffs, ostensibly to encourage people to pay up on time: about one in 20 households were disconnected in 2016, according to research by Food and Water Watch (FWW). In addition, more than 2 million people do not have indoor plumbing  no running water or flushing toilet. Nationwide, nobody knows how many Americans were without water at the start of the pandemic  nor how many have been disconnected since. What is known is that financial aid to help families and utilities keep taps running has so far been excluded from federal rescue packages. The water and sewage industries estimate $26.4bn in lost revenue, mostly as a result of the industrial and business lockdown  which is fuelling concern that small towns may feel forced to sell off their utilities to big for-profit corporations. It is appalling that the federal government is still dragging its feet, said Mary Grant of FWW. Congress must act in the publics interests and order a national moratorium on water shutoffs while providing financial relief to our local public water providers. Our communities are in crisis and cant wait any longer.","966"
"2020-05-01T09:00:20Z","world","World news","Retail workers at Amazon and Whole Foods coordinate sick-out to protest Covid-19 conditions","Hundreds of workers at Amazon warehouses, Whole Foods grocery stores, Target retail stores, and shoppers at Instacart and Shipt called out sick on Friday as part of a coordinated one-day strike across the US in protest of working conditions and inadequate safety protections during the coronavirus pandemic. The 1 May walkout began after Amazon ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy for workers at the end of April. The fact they took it away prior to the sick-out lets you know theyre aware of the sickout and trying to stop people from participating in that, said Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, who has worked at Amazon for more than four years. Now theyre forcing people to go to work because if you run out of unpaid time off, thats it, youre fired.   Related: Hundreds of Amazon warehouse workers to call in sick in coronavirus protest   Palmer was one of the workers who participated in protests outside of JFK8 warehouse a few weeks ago in demand of safety protections for Amazon workers. An assistant manager at JFK8, Chris Smalls, was fired shortly after he organized the protest. Palmer said that after the protests, Amazon began providing personal protective equipment to workers and enforcing social distancing rules and temperature checks, but he said cleaning procedures remain inadequate. While we respect peoples right to express themselves, we object to the irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon during this unprecedented health and economic crisis, said the spokesperson in an email. At Target, workers complained it took too long for the company to provide workers with personal protective equipment, and little is being done to enforce social distancing within stores. According to Target Workers Unite, over 100 stores and some distribution centers are represented in the sickout.    Customers line up to enter a Target store in Falls Church, Virginia, on 20 April. Photograph: Sait Serkan Gurbuz/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock   Im participating because Target Corporation has not designed or enforced adequate protection for its workers, said Sophie Haras, who has worked at a Target store in Hadley, Massachusetts for over one year. Social distancing guidelines are regularly ignored by both employees and guests, and the amount of customers allowed inside the store is in the hundreds, so high that my store leader, among others, has decided not to count customers at all. Target has also neglected to be transparent about positive cases of Covid-19, both in our stores and distribution centers. Michelle Enright, a department specialist at Target in Sterling Heights, Michigan for 28 years, is participating in the sick out due to the lack of protections provided to workers during the pandemic. There is no support from Target corporate, said Enright. What we want to do is make the point we are humans, we can get sick, and were not just pieces of a machine. A Target spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: While we take them seriously, the concerns raised are from a very small minority. The vast majority of our more than 340,000 frontline team members have expressed pride in the role they are playing in helping provide for families across the country during this time of need. Whole Foods workers organized their first sick-out protest on 31 March, and are joining the 1 May day of action calling on more workers to join the sick-out and participate in organized protests. The sick-out includes demands such as increased hazard pay, paid sick leave for workers who choose to isolate or self-quarantine, and the closure of stores in response to confirmed coronavirus cases among workers. At least two Whole Foods employees have died from coronavirus, and over 200 workers have tested positive around the US.    A worker sanitizes shopping carts at a Whole Foods in Los Angeles. Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press   We are organizing a sickout on May 1 to call on Whole Foods to provide the protective measures listed in our demands, which they have not provided despite internal complaints, a letter from fourteen state attorney generals, and concerns raised with OSHA, said Dan Steinbrook, a Whole Foods employee in the Boston, Massachusetts area and one of the organizers of the sick out. A Whole Foods spokesperson disputed the claims of workers calling for the sickout protest. Our focus right now is ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our Team Members, which remains our top priority, while continuing to serve our customers and communities, said the spokesperson. Shoppers at Instacart organized their first sick-out protest on 30 March, and Shipt shoppers launched their own independent sick-out protest on 7 April. Vanessa Bain, an Instacart shopper in the San Francisco, California, area and an organizer of the sick out, noted few Instacart shoppers have received personal protective equipment kits in response to demands made during their first sick-out protest. She received a PPE kit, which included a paper-thin mask, hand sanitizer, and a thermometer that didnt work. As Instacart hired 300,000 new shoppers in the month of April, and continues to hire more to keep up with increased demands for grocery delivery services, Bain asserts Instacart has to take meaningful action to protect workers and the public during this pandemic. Were trying to build a movement across companies and elevate each others demands, said Bain. Were all in the same position as frontline workers making similar demands that companies have failed to meet that are basic and essential to be able to do our jobs safely. An Instacart spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: We remain singularly focused on the health and safety of the Instacart community. Our team has been diligently working to offer new policies, guidelines, product features, resources, increased bonuses, and personal protective equipment to ensure the health and safety of shoppers during this critical time.","923"

But, more than a century ago, the last of the thundering herds that stampeded across the grasslands disappeared. But the birth of a wild bison calf has renewed hopes that rebuilding sustainable herds is now a step closer. On 22 April, a herd in Wanuskewin heritage park, an Indigenous-run conservation area in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, grew by one member  the first time a calf had been born on the territory since 1876.    A close up of the new arrival. Photograph: Wanuskewin Heritage Park   Hailing the new arrival as historic, Wanuskewins chief executive said the birth was a step in the right direction. We feel humbled and blessed for the arrival the baby bison and for the herd thats with it, said Darlene Brander. Brander said that after consultation with a council of elders, the decision was made to not name the calf. The elders told us that because bison are the brothers and sisters of many Indigenous peoples across the land, it wouldnt be appropriate to give the newborn a name, she said. Weve really been making effort to get guidance from elders on this, because their knowledge is critical to maintaining our traditions. The fluffy orange calf is just the first step in a far more ambitious strategy to repopulate the sweeping landscapes. Bison numbers across the continent collapsed in the late 1800s  largely the result of overhunting by settlers, as well as disease and habitat degradation. Populations dropped from nearly 60 million to fewer than 600. Indigenous communities, which had long relied on plentiful bison populations, were left without a valuable source of food. Our societies revolved around the bison  every single bit of it was used and consumed, said Brander. The near-extinction had a huge impact. At the turn of the century, a handful of ranchers began breeding bison with cattle to create the cattle-o hybrid, hoping they would be better suited to the cold climate. The idea was a reasonable one. But it really didnt work very well, says Dr Gregg Adams, head of the bison project at the University of Saskatchewans Western College of Veterinary Medicine.   Related: How Native American tribes are bringing back the bison from brink of extinction   These hybrid animals now make up the vast majority of North American bison and only two herds in Yellowstone national park in the United States and Elk Island, Alberta, Canada  are genetically pure. In Canada, only 1,500 wild, genetically pure bison survive all descended from roughly 50 individuals that werent crossbred in the 1900s. But Parks Canada hopes that, by creating new herds across the country, more genetic resiliency and diversity will develop over time. Bison have already been reintroduced to Banff National Park, a feat Parks Canada calls a historic, ecological and cultural triumph. Such efforts are still threatened by the spectre of disease, but pioneering research at the University of Saskatchewan holds promise for overcoming such challenges. We can literally wash the gametes  the semen and embryo  free of diseases, cryopreserve them and then bring them out of the park and use their genetics on other conservation herds, said Adams. Even when a hybrid female is inseminated with purebred embryos, the result is a purebred calf. However, herds numbering in the thousands are unlikely to ever return. We know now that there are too many roads, too many fences, too many borders, across the Great Plains. Were never going to have these massive wandering herds of bison again, said Adams. But some degree of repopulation will be possible  and will have immense benefits for the land. There are numerous studies that show the impact bison recovery has for an ecosystem all the way down to dung beetles, bird species, prairie dogs and carnivores, said Adams. Bison affect the entire ecosystem from microbes to insects to mammals and humans. Wanuskewin  a historic bison hunting ground for numerous Indigenous groups, including the Cree, Assiniboine and Blackfoot people  received its first herd of plains bison in December as part of the repopulation effort. Eleven animals arrived, sourced from nearby Grasslands national park and Yellowstone national park in the United States. When the bison were released from the trailer, people were overcome with emotion. Some tears shed, including my own. People just felt it in their hearts and souls, said Brander. To hear the sound of hooves thundering across the prairies, accompanied by the drums that were part of the ceremonial protocols, it was so powerful. It was a once in a lifetime experience.","746"

Having my friends and partner with me, this time has actually been really nice. But its crowded. I find it funny watching people back at home [in Leicester] posting things such as, What are you Londoners doing going out? Sit in your garden! Im like, really? We live in a two bedroom flat, theres no outdoor area. Weve all been cooking a lot and most nights we will sit together and watch a film. Ive got a little French bulldog, shes four months old and shes making sure I get that hour of exercise every day.    Damian Marleys Welcome to Jamrock reminds me of being with my family, being a kid and things being easy. When I was younger, my mum used to play reggae in the house and the car. Weve been listening to a lot of reggae in lockdown  when youre cleaning and dancing around the flat, its a vital part of the morning. It just sets you up right for the day.    Put Your Records On, that song makes me feel great. Corinne Bailey Rae was huge for me, growing up, because she was this brown-skinned girl with her curls out who grew up in Leeds. Even though Im not from the north, it resonated with me more than artists from London. She really inspired me. That song for me is all about nostalgia and youth.    Toosie Slide is a jam and its on every day. Its been really fun because weve all just been pretending that we can do the little dance. Ive been doing it in the kitchen, but I would never film it in a million years.    HER just put a new song out called Comfortable  I play it mostly in the evening when Im taking my makeup off or doing a little skincare routine. She oozes this really calming thing in her music and talks about love in the most delicate way. I love the way she shapes relationships, she does it exquisitely.    A song I was playing yesterday, that Id completely forgot I loved, is India.Aries I Am Not My Hair. Shes talking about the struggle that she went through as a black woman in the US with her natural hair. As a kid who struggled with that, it took me a long time to accept and love what I looked like. India.Arie was a huge part of that development. Quarantine has been difficult  Ive definitely, in this time, gone through a journey with my confidence. Because were all not wearing makeup, not getting ready to go anywhere, its easy to feel a bit shit about yourself. That song is very empowering for me  that whole notion of: I am not my physical appearance, that isnt all I am.    When you have certain things that make you feel like youre in control, its a lot easier to get up every day and get going. Thats why being able to write music at home was a huge plus for me. It meant that I had purpose again. When I was younger and first started writing songs, I began on [production software] Logic, using tools and working with vocals. So [going back to it] was like muscle memory. I was looking at a load of music in a file Id created when I was making the album. I found these three songs, and I was like, oh my God, I love these songs  and itd be sick if, in isolation, I could finish them and get them out. So I called my manager and we made a plan for a new release, Isolation Tapes.  Isolation Tapes by Mahalia is out now on Asylum Records.","632"
"2020-05-01T09:00:20Z","environment","Environment","Alarm over deaths of bees from rapidly spreading viral disease","A viral disease that causes honey bees to suffer severe trembling, flightlessness and death within a week is spreading exponentially in Britain. Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) was only recorded in Lincolnshire in 2007. A decade later, it was found in 39 of 47 English counties and six of eight Welsh counties, according to data collected from visits to more than 24,000 beekeepers. As well as struggling to fly, the afflicted bees develop shiny, hairless abdomens. Piles of dead individuals are found outside hives with whole colonies frequently wiped out by the disease. A team of scientists led by Prof Giles Budge of Newcastle University identified clusterings of the disease, with cases concentrated among apiaries run by professional beekeepers rather than amateur keepers. In the study, published in Nature Communications, scientists used data from 130,000 honey bee imports from 25 countries to show for the first time that the disease was nearly twice as likely in apiaries owned by beekeepers who imported honey bees. Professional beekeepers bring in honey bee queens to replenish their hives every few years. Another way in which commercial beekeeping could be contributing to the spread of the disease is because they tend to manage large colonies, and the virus appears to be rapidly transmitted in densely populated hives. But Budge said it was not clear that the disease was imported via queens and it was unfair to claim the disease was caused by industrial beekeeping. The bee farmers of this country tend to be quite small-scale. A standard bee farmer might have 100 to 200 colonies. In the States, they have up to 10,000. Even in Germany there will be huge-scale beekeeping going on, he said. According to Budge, professional beekeepers may run into problems in Britain because they are very successful at bringing bees through the winter and building up colonies in spring to take advantage of early flowers such as oilseed rape. If the weather then turns wet, these large colonies are then confined to a hive. You cant do social distancing in a hive as easily but you can manage it by increasing the space in there, said Budge. The viral disease has been around for centuries  its symptoms were first described by Aristotle  but researchers are keen to discover if a new, more virulent strain is behind its global surge. In the United States, CBPV prevalence was 0.7% in 2010 but reached 16% in 2014. Prevalence doubled in Italy from 5% to 10% between 2009 and 2010. In China, prevalence has grown from 9% to 38%. Infected adult bees carry the virus for up to six days without showing symptoms, and may spread it to other colonies at sites where different bees forage for food. But honey bees typically do not forage further than 10km in Britain, and the study found significant clusters of the disease up to 40km apart. A quarter of beekeepers have multiple sites, so could be assisting the spread of the disease. Although the disease appears to burn out in Britain and does not recur in hotspots between seasons, it returns to the country in other locations over time. The disease has also been found in wild bumblebee and ant populations, but the direction of transmission is not clear. Rob Nickless, chairman of the Bee Farmers Association, which supported the study, said: This is the sort of research that brings practical benefits to the industry  helping bee farmers at grassroots level to improve honey bee health and increase UK honey production. Researchers will continue to examine the genetics of the disease to determine if there is a new strain and seek to discover whether imported queens are bringing the disease into Britain, or whether those queens are simply more susceptible to the virus that is already here.","631"

She says her sleep cycle is now messed up, making it difficult to study. I have friends who take classes post-midnight, she says, and everyone is worried about exams. Navlakha is one of many international students who have fled the UK to be with family without their belongings, and dont know when theyll be able to return to collect them due to lockdowns, border closures, or cancelled flights. International students from outside the EU are meanwhile paying the highest rates for their tuition. Some who went home are attending online lectures at night because of time differences. Harshita Iyer, 25, studying at the London School of Economics (LSE), is back in Canada with a five-hour time difference. Im lucky most of my classes are in the afternoon, but I know people who have lectures at 1am, she says. She is also worried about how the time difference will affect her ability to do upcoming exams. Some who have returned home have internet problems. Shanavi Dessai, 18, who is one of around 400 international students at the University of Sussex to have signed an open letter calling on the university to reimburse their fees, is back in India. Its monsoon season here soon and electricity problems are rampant, she says. This is honestly horrible. Alex Arroyo, 18, studying at the University of Portsmouth, is stuck in Menorca trying to study online without his laptop. My return flight was cancelled and Ive been in lockdown for five weeks, he says. I left everything in the flat. Arroyo says hes been using his iPad to study but cant access all of the sites he needs. He studies in the kitchen, as the WiFi is better, but says its difficult to concentrate with all of the family stuck at home, too. For those stranded in the UK there are also difficulties. Bart Schermers, 23, is studying at LSE and has only just made it home to the Netherlands. He says he experienced a nervous atmosphere in his private student accommodation in London, which housed around 200 students. On the floor below me a flat was sick [with coronavirus]. We use the same elevator, doors and hallways, so it didnt feel safe, he says. Schermers is on a rent strike to try to break his housing contract. Tama Knight, studying at LSE and from Canada, decided to stay put because her sister and mother back home are at high risk from Covid-19. Like Schermers, she says she was scared to stay in cramped university accommodation. Instead, Knight moved into her partners flat, but now faces the daunting prospect of having to pay thousands of pounds in double rent for six months, because she cant get out of her student housing contract. I dont qualify for any financial assistance because Im not a UK citizen, and [to qualify for financial assistance from Canada] you have to have been working for the past 12 months. It leaves me in a scary situation, she says.   Related: University students: Have you stayed or returned to your term time address?   Growing numbers of students are facing financial hardship during the lockdown, after losing work and support from parents. Dessai says many international students, who are not entitled to domestic loans and pay far higher fees, are also worried about how they will cope financially. Many students, including Iyer, lost jobs due to the pandemic. Loanna Siomou, 19, studying at the University of Bedfordshire, has recently made it home to Greece but was frightened at the prospect of being stuck abroad with little money  especially when she saw empty supermarket shelves, as she couldnt afford to stock up. It was scary to think I could have been stuck in a foreign country with nothing to eat because I couldnt afford it, she says. Its perhaps particularly unnerving to be overseas during a crisis. In many ways its harder when abroad, Knight says. I dont know how I would get home, so its very stressful. Many will have planned and saved for years to study in the UK. International students came here with a dream, Anne Marie Graham, chief executive of the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA), says. Many of them have travelled huge distances and left families behind. Studying abroad is a pretty emotional experience at the best of times, so to do it through a crisis is understandably really difficult.

The AIS framework, developed in conjunction with various medical experts and sporting organisations, is based on a three-tiered system  levels A, B and C  designed to facilitate the gradual resumption of activities in a cautious and methodical manner. On Friday the government released its 15 principles for the resumption of sport and recreation, which said the AIS framework would provide a general guide, but decisions on when to implement each phase would be made in close consultation with federal, state/territory and local public health authorities Resumption of sport can significantly contribute to the re-establishment of normality in Australian society, the AIS states in its framework document.

"2020-05-01T08:35:40Z","world","World news","Morrison says 'early mark' of eased restrictions depends on uptake of Covidsafe tracing app","Scott Morrison has offered Australians an early mark to ease Covid-19 restrictions next week while warning a return to normality will depend on uptake of the Covidsafe contact tracing app. The prime minister dangled the prospect of a potential loosening of the rules next Friday as he issued his strongest declaration yet that it was conditional on more downloads. Morrison also revealed that net overseas migration is down 30% and is expected to fall by 80% in 2020-21, both compared with 2018-19, in a sign the economic contraction from Covid-19 will last much longer than restrictions to social life. Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank both estimate that unemployment is set to top 10%. The first restrictions were eased this week with New South Wales allowing visits to friends and relatives, and a similar measure announced on Friday in the Australian Capital Territory, the first Australian jurisdiction with no active cases.   Related: Remdesivir: five Australian hospitals to receive experimental coronavirus drug   The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, described allowing family visits and resumption of non-essential retail as a downpayment on further changes to be considered next week, expected to include allowing small outdoor gatherings as a first step out of the lockdown. Morrison said two further meetings of national cabinet were scheduled next week and then leaders would decide next Friday about how restrictions can be eased. Morrison told reporters in Canberra that 3.5 million Australians have downloaded the Covidsafe tracing app, explaining that boosting downloads is one of four unmet conditions to ease restrictions. We need that tool so that we can open up the economy, he said, declining to nominate a precise target. Its over to you, Australia. Morrison acknowledged the need to tread carefully. We do not want to go into a start-stop or  even worse  a reverse process into the future, he said. The health minister, Greg Hunt, had previously suggested a target of 40%  which would suggest as many as 10 million Australians would need to download the app  but that figure was disavowed by health department officials who have said even 20% would be a good result. Morrison noted that regulations governing the app prevent employers mandating employees download it, but suggested businesses, including cafes, would encourage their patrons to do so in a bid to restart the economy. Appearing alongside the sports and aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, Morrison announced an extra $205m for the aged care sector to implement an industry code of practice on protection against Covid-19. Colbeck said the national cabinet had developed a set of principles for phased resumption of community sport, starting with non-contact activities with 10 or fewer participants ramping up to full contact training and competition.   Related: Coronavirus numbers in Australia: how many new cases are there? Covid-19 map, statistics and graph   According to a government statement, the initial phase allows for the resumption of childrens outdoor sport with strict physical distancing measures for non-sporting attendees such as parents, and outdoor recreational activities including outdoor-based personal training and boot camps, golf, fishing, bush-walking, and swimming. But the principles note that individual jurisdictions will determine progression through these phases. Even with the prospect of restrictions being eased, the economic impacts of the coronavirus crisis continue to mount. Morrison said Australia was facing a significant fall in net overseas migration which would trigger a lag impact on the Australian economy beyond the immediate health crisis. He argued it was not a long-term change, suggesting it would be reasonable to assume borders would be open by the end of 2021, but he noted Australia had outperformed expectations in the past six weeks. Morrison revealed some 650,000 businesses had signed up to the jobkeeper program, an increase on the 540,000 businesses and 3.3 million employees reported by Treasury officials on Tuesday. Morrison played down the possibility of further changes to the $130bn program, noting that there are many calls on the federal budget  including jobseeker unemployment benefits  and the commonwealth has no plans to change eligibility of either program beyond administrative changes. Morrison also said it was too soon to say whether the free childcare package would be extended beyond late June, when it is due to expire. The government has previously kept the door open to having it in place for six months, similar to other support packages, but there have been lingering concerns across the childcare sector that their normal funding is down. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said testing for Covid-19 would be expanded to include samples of certain groups that were not showing symptoms  including health and aged care workers and elective surgery patients. The aim of this testing, Murphy said, was to make sure that our confidence that we dont have significant asymptomatic transmission is correct. The governments latest modelling on the effective rate of transmission covers fewer states than last week, because of a lack of data. In the two states where there were adequate figures  NSW and Tasmania  the rate of transmission remained below 1, meaning one person with the virus transmitted it to fewer than one person on average. Murphy said Tasmania was comfortably now below the 1 benchmark, as it had brought the outbreak in the north-west of the state under control.","846"
"2020-05-01T08:20:19Z","film","Film","All Day and a Night review – stylish Netflix father-son crime drama","Its an unusually stacked week for new films on Netflix (one they might regret when pre-pandemic content starts to dry up) with a teen comedy, a B-thriller and a romantic documentary all launching before the weekend, a feast for viewers at home but a glut that could overshadow one of their finer offerings quietly releasing alongside. All Day and a Night, a tough-minded drama from Black Panther co-writer Joe Robert Cole, might not be quite worthy enough for their awards slate (although its a damn sight more compelling than The Two Popes ) but its a step up from what one might expect of an unhyped May movie from the streamer. Think of it as a classier boutique release, deserving of a higher shelf placement.   Related: The Half of It review  charming Netflix teen comedy takes on Cyrano   We first meet Jahkor (Ashton Sanders) as hes breaking into the house of a couple before shooting them both dead in front of their young daughter. The film them splits into three timelines, each delicately balanced by Cole, as we see Jahkor as a child (played with heartbreaking conviction by Jalyn Hall) abused by his addict father JD (Jeffrey Wright), Jahkor getting involved in criminal actvities in the months before the killing and Jahkor in prison. Its a reflective movie, with a reflective title, as he revisits the ups and downs that led him to a life sentence and while the film offers explanations, it never offers excuses, with a considerable grey area at its centre.    Whats initially most striking about All Day and a Night (other than the intensity of Sanders stare) is just how much it feels like an actual movie. Discarding the flat TV palette so many other Netflix-funded film-makers seem happy to stick with, writer-director Cole clearly has something a lot grander in his sights and he squeezes every last drop from his limited budget, working as if the intention was for a far bigger screen. Its stylish work but Cole avoids gimmicky flourishes, which would have been an easy fallback given the material, and instead maintains an evocative aesthetic while providing a number of standout visual sequences  one particular one-shot party that takes us from inside a venue and out through the streets is more cinematic than most Netflix originals combined. Some of his turf war plotting is a bit muddled but its his character study of a boy whos not quite sure how to be a man that proves more interesting. Via an often insightful and often hackneyed voiceover, Jahkor talks about the prison he was born into, how as a young black man living in a working-class neighbourhood he has always been surrounded by four walls, they just became more noticeable when he was sent away. He speaks of the little cuts, the micro-aggressions he has to encounter from the the teacher who has already given up on him to the racist white customer at the shoe store where he works whos already judged him to the cops who are eager to imprison him, the cuts that slowly make him bleed. His toxic father is both aggressor and victim himself, an addict with mental health issues without the help he so sorely needs. Cole makes some moves toward blaming a bigger system, one without the resources or empathy to help people at the bottom, but ensures that his characters are never just victims, theyre active in their choices even if their choices are limited. Its a messy world and Cole refuses to make it more palatable for us, inspiring tough questions while withholding easy answers. Theres a small but ferocious turn from Wright but its Sanders who dominates, building both on his standout performance from Moonlight and his film-elevating work since in Native Son and Captive State. While I look forward to seeing him expand his repertoire with something a bit more left-field in the future, hes on fine form again here, rising to the challenge of his biggest lead to date, drawing us into Jahkors plight even when his actions are hard to defend. Hes a difficult character, the result of a difficult father, and while their scenes together are limited, Cole refrains from obvious soapy conflict, opting instead, finally, for something far more believable and far more poignant. Jahkor is being told not to follow in his fathers footsteps, including by his father himself, but not being given the tools or room to do so. Its a sad but not entirely hopeless tale with an ending that offers room for interpretation, based on the viewers optimism or pessimism over what could come next. All Day and a Night is a weightier alternative to the average Netflix original and while imperfectly realised and scrappily plotted at times, its another promising sign that, away from the easy-to-digest content, theres room on the platform for much much more.  All Day and a Night is now available on Netflix ","809"
"2020-05-01T08:10:19Z","books","Books","I wish more people would read ... HG Wells's Mr Britling Sees It Through","Last year I wrote a literary biography of HG Wells, a task that, of course, entailed reading all his novels. I already knew his science fiction and some of his other novels, but Id never read his first world war masterpiece Mr Britling Sees It Through, which was published in 1916. To this day I dont know anyone who has. Yet in its day this was one of Wellss most successful books (it was the bestselling novel in the world in 1917) and attracted hyperbolic praise. Maxim Gorky called it the finest, most courageous, truthful and humane book written in Europe in the course of this accursed war. Strange to think a book so fted and successful could drop so comprehensively off the radar. What makes it stranger is that the novel is exactly as good as Wellss contemporaries thought: a wonderfully detailed, evocative and moving portrait of England at war. Britling himself is a Wellsian self-portrait: a successful writer, living comfortably in his Essex home of Matchings Easy; married to his second wife, raising a son, Hugh, and two stepchildren, and conducting a discreet affair with an attractive neighbour. Part one, Matchings Easy at Ease, compiles a leisurely but compelling portrait of the long Edwardian summer of 1914. The second part, Matchings Easy at War, describes the impact of the war on the home front. Hugh lies about his age and signs up, and his letters to his father are full of vivid detail about life in the trenches. When he is killed  a freak shot catches him through a loop in the trenchs defences  the novel pivots to a heartbreaking account of his fathers grief. As the novel ends, Britling is reaching a fragile but hopeful epiphany, his atheism dissolving into a belief in God. This ending could easily have struck a merely sentimental, or an awkwardly pious, note, but in fact it does neither. It is testament to Wellss skill as a writer how moving the conclusion is. This is a novel that portrays war not as an arena for action and heroism, but as a passivity, a state in which there is nothing to be done and everything to be endured. Of course thats how war is for those left at home, but whats remarkable is the way the novels portrait of the western front, via Hughs lengthy letters to his father, describes the fighting in these terms, too. Wellss soldiers are not agents; their war is one of stalemate and inaction. That reflects the nature of trench warfare itself, of course; and while this became a commonplace of how the first world war was described, Wellss novel was one of the first to capture this. It also includes the first portrait in fiction of what we now call PTSD, or shell shock. When his friend Captain Carmine returns home on leave, Britling is startled to find the soldier broken, white and jaded, as if he had not slept for many nights. Britling himself is a masterpiece of characterisation: wholly believable, often silly and pompous but rounded and real. Wells really doesnt spare any of his own foibles in his self-portraiture. But though he is comical at the beginning, he ends the novel with real dignity: Britling, this little Briton, sees it through in the sense that he endures and survives the trauma of war. (Look!, as DH Lawrences end-of-war poetry collection famously exclaimed, We Have Come Through!). But more importantly, Britling sees through it, the muddle and pain of mundane existence, to something transcendent. There seems to me something wise and important to be learned from such a tale, and most especially today, as we all languish in the enforced passivity and misery of our present moment. ","622"
"2020-05-01T08:04:12Z","law","Law","Labour: livestream court cases during and after Covid-19 crisis","Online streaming of public court cases should become the norm during and after lockdown to create a more transparent and fair justice system, Labour has said. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, and Charles Falconer, the shadow attorney general, have written to the government calling for an emergency action plan to restart the incapacitated justice system and for longer-term changes. The letter to the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, proposes measures to address systematic and historic failings that have left courts critically weakened long before the coronavirus crisis began. It says many victims and defendants are being left in limbo as trials are being postponed indefinitely. Courts and tribunals should maintain physical distancing during the pandemic, Labours justice team says, and all court cases  with the exception of certain criminal, family and youth cases  should be streamed online and accessible to all. That should continue after the Covid-19 crisis, Labour says.   Related: Court hearings via video 'risk unfairness for disabled people'   The letter from Lammy and Falconer also advocates investing in early advice services and legal aid to expand access to justice, as well as greater financial support to ensure barristers and solicitors firms can survive the crisis. All jury trials and many non-urgent cases have been suspended during the lockdown but most of the higher civil courts  the supreme court, court of appeal, high court and family court  are conducting remote hearings via video links. The media, but not the public, are being given online access. The supreme court already livestreams its hearings, and some court of appeal hearings are also broadcast live. This year the Ministry of Justice backed expanding camera use in court so that judges sentencing convicted offenders in high-profile criminal cases in England and Wales, including murders, rapes and other serious offences, can be televised. Lammy said: There were already huge backlogs in court cases before the Covid-19 crisis began. If urgent decisions are not made now, the justice system will be at breaking point by the autumn. Many large courtrooms, university lecture halls, schools and leisure centres are currently sitting empty. The Ministry of Justice should co-opt these buildings if necessary to carry out socially distanced trials according to public health advice. Justice delayed must not be allowed to become justice denied. He said open justice was a fundamental right but current restrictions on non-essential travel meant most members of the public could not attend court. To maintain public confidence in the justice system, with a few exceptions, all court cases should be streamed online, he said. Labour is calling for the livestreaming of cases to become the norm during and after the Covid-19 crisis because a more transparent system is a fairer system, which gives greater access to justice for us all.    A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: Judges and staff deserve huge credit for keeping dozens of courts open during this pandemic, and have overseen a vast increase in video and audio hearings. The public can be confident that we are doing everything possible to ensure justice is still seen and heard, for instance through remote hearings. While jury trials were suspended to protect the public, we are working closely with the judiciary and others to resume them as soon as possible. The Labour letter says the opposition wants to work constructively with the government, but we have serious concerns regarding not only how the justice system has become incapacitated by the crisis, but also around how our critically weakened infrastructure will cope with the enormous challenge it will face post Covid-19. A first priority must be rebuilding services and restoring some of the legal aid which since 2012 has been stripped from most areas of early legal advice, including housing, family matters, employment, welfare and immigration. To continue the suspension of trials for an indeterminate time would result in a backlog of cases which could seize [up] the wheels of justice for many years to come. The government must act urgently to allow jury trials to restart in a way that is safe, the letter says. However, Labour does not support proposals for allowing jurors to participate in trials remotely from home. Unfortunately, many people across the country do not have [quiet or private rooms] or access to the required technology. Until comprehensive solutions are found to prevent remote juries from becoming socially unbalanced juries, we cannot support them.","717"

The artist has been on a storied journey through the music industry and the public eye: first emerging as the 13-year-old singer of Leave (Get Out), she then spent years mired in legal disputes with her label that prevented her releasing music. After reigniting her passionate fanbase with a string of independent, darker-sounding mixtapes (and one viral Drake cover), she released Mad Love, her long-delayed third album, in 2016. But Good to Know, released on her own imprint Clover Music, with its themes of independence and self-knowledge, carries with it a sense that she has finally arrived as the kind of artist she was always meant to be.    Good to Know album cover Photograph: PR   Slowed down to a treacle pace and layered in indulgent harmonies, these bass-rich songs are the most mature JoJo has ever recorded. Its a hangover album (one spacious, swirling song is named Pedialyte, for the rehydration drink), all about making clear-eyed assessments of past bad decisions in the light of day. JoJo picks herself apart, whispering about not being able to get over an ex on Think About You, and belting about her insecurity on Lonely Hearts. Her voice, always impressive, is now an intimidating muscle, and while her message occasionally brushes against empowerment-pop cliche, the naked passion in her vocal sells every line. In light of her legal battles (and recent accusations that her former record label once put her on a 500-calories-a-day diet), her declarations of self-love also carry special import. On Man, the albums stand-out single-lady anthem, JoJo sings: Ive been down, but Im back up. Its a joy to hear.","287"

Especially lately, with their Lets find the laughs in suicidal ideation (Aisling Beas This Way Up) or Examining the return to normality after serving 18 years for murder, but with lols (Daisy Haggards Back to Life). Haggard, of course, also stars in Breeders, a similar comedy cliff-face, a brutally honest, brutally funny study of what real parenthood, the kind shorn of sentimentality, looks like. And yet, somehow, they surmount it. All of the above are bold, shining little nuggets of gold, alchemised from what, to the rest of us, looks like lead. Now it is the turn of Andy Wolton, whose show Trying  the 23rd original show from Apple TV+ and the companys first European production  is a comedy about adoption in the wake of a couples infertility. Obviously  obviously  individual viewers mileages will vary with this even more than with most comedies, depending on how close to home it strikes and how raw or painful any personal experiences still are. But it seems to me that Wolton  an adoptee himself, who made a pilot a few years back about a family of adopted children called The Coopers vs The Rest  treats the subject with compassion. As is so often the case, the opening episode isnt its best  there is an over-reliance on the traditional dramatic tropes of the childless couple (making awkward jokes about fontanelles to new mothers and so on), but it quickly finds its feet. The couples situation isnt exploited for laughs  the absurdities inherent in it are explored, which is different. Call centre operator Nikki (Esther Smith) and Tefl teacher Jason (Rafe Spall) are in their 30s, very much aware that the people in the bars they used to frequent unthinkingly are now all 10 years younger than them. They have been trying for a baby long enough to have exhausted their NHS IVF cycles but have enough hope left to partake of emergency shags on public transport when they realise this months ovulation window is about to close. Then they find out that because of complications  ages, durations and medical details are all wisely kept vague  a baby of their biological own will never be possible. Let me get you another leaflet, says the doctor. So, amid the endless round of pregnancy announcements and christenings that characterise your mid-30s as surely as weddings do the decade before and STIs do the decade before that, they begin to consider adoption. Can they, should they? When they havent even got the lampshades up in every room yet? They retreat, then talk themselves and each other round again, with truths both tongue in cheek (Weve only got to be better than the previous parents) and bitter (We waited till we were ready once before, didnt we? And we were far too late). Once they have decided, finally, in favour, the profound, dizzying unnaturalness of having to codify and commodify yourself into a potential parent via forms and questionnaires instead of simply having sex and a baby quickly engulfs them. In the second episode, they realise that ex-partners will be approached for what are, in effect, references and Jason must arrange a meeting with Jane (Cush Jumbo), the woman he was with before Nikki.  In fact, not entirely before Nikki, which makes things awkward. But in the first of many mini-plotlines that will turn from comedy to tragedy and back again, it is not the memory of his infidelity that ends up hurting Jane most but the realisation that Jason has become the man you hated me for telling you you could be  Youre a better man because you practised on me. Its a scene that has been done before, but I have never seen it done less hysterically or given so much time to breathe. And even more rarely  for myriad reasons  have I seen what happens next. Jason is allowed the right of reply. It wasnt my intention, he says. Its just  life. The adoption content is the flesh, but it is moments such as these, relatable surely in one way or another for any member of the human race, that provide the skeleton. The genuinely loving, intimate banter between Nikki and Jason in their quieter moments too is one of the series greatest strengths. All this and Imelda Staunton as their social worker Penny still to come. Its well worth trying.","735"

RBS announced on Friday that pre-tax profits had fallen to 519m in the first three months of 2020, comparedwith just over 1bn a year earlier.     Profits were hit by an 802m provision, a sum set aside to cover potential loan losses due to an economic downturn that could make it harder for its retail and business customers to repay their debts. Analysts were expecting a 515m charge, according to consensus estimates compiled by the lender. The Edinburgh-based bank, which is changing its parent name to NatWest this year, said the group has significant exposures to many of the commercial sectors that are already being impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, including property, retail, leisure, travel and shipping.     Alison Rose, the chief executive, said: Having been involved and worked through the financial crisis, Im aware of the importance of the financial stability and strength and liquidity of the bank which is a core priority for me.  She assured that RBS was well diversified going into the crisis: Were comfortable with the level of risk on our books, including the new lending and the government schemes. RBS accounts for the largest proportion of lending through the UKs government-backed coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which has been widely criticised for being slow to distribute funds to struggling firms. The bank has so far approved 1.6bn to 8,292 businesses, or 31% of the 25,262 total. RBS said it had a share of about 20% of the small and medium-sized business banking market. The chief financial officer, Katie Murray, said while CBILS would not be hugely profitable for the lender she expected a nominal return from the loans. Rose said it was inevitable that some businesses would fail during the crisis, but RBS has not yet had a surge in insolvencies or payment delinquencies as customers have taken advantage of government support. Across the entire bank, Rose noted a slowdown in spending and a rise in deposits during the lockdown. RBS forecasts a 4.3% drop in UK economic growth for 2020. Of course we will suffer losses on our books as the crisis plays out, but we think its too early to estimate the shape and scale of the economic impacts, Rose said.   The RBS provision brings the total loan loss charges announced by the five largest UK banks to about 7.4bn for the first quarter. A provision of 1.4bn nearly wiped out first-quarter profits at Lloyds Banking Group, which fell 95% to 74m. On Wednesday, Barclays reported a 38% drop in pre-tax profits after taking a 2.1bn charge to cover bad debts, which it predicted could soar to 4.5bn by the end of the year.    This week HSBC warned it could end up setting aside $11bn (8.8bn) to cover loan losses for 2020, after the pandemic hit its main markets across Asia and Europe. It reported a first-quarter charge of $3bn (2.4bn). Standard Chartered also revealed a $962m (776m) loan loss charge on Wednesday that pushed first-quarter pre-tax profits down 29% to $886m. RBS, which is still 62% owned by the taxpayer after its 45.5bn bailout in 2008, also announced it was winding down its fledgling digital retail bank, B, months after its launch in November. It plans to fold the technology into Mettle, its digital bank for small and medium-sized business customers.","582"

Jurd seems unconcerned by transient fashions or enrolment in any kind of scene, and pursues a private muse that draws on jazz, folk traditions from Europe and the Middle East, and the harmonic language of Stravinsky  yet her work is always spiritedly accessible, and often suggests wordless songs. To the Earth is Jurds third release with her Dinosaur quartet, a closely bonded ensemble embodying the jazz axiom that composition and improvisation are an inseparable two-way stretch.    These seven tracks run to barely more than than 40 minutes but Dinosaur make them all count. The title track hooks attention with its opening treble-chord piano splash from Elliot Galvin, signalling Conor Chaplins repeating bass vamp, the arrival of a vivacious trumpet melody of folk-dance triplet twists and coolly jazzy resolutions, and Corrie Dicks implacable percussion pulse. The dirge-like, ghostly Slow Loris finds Jurd in a voicelike early-jazz mood of muted trumpet sounds and growls (sometimes deepening the brass harmonies on tenor horn), while Galvin solos in unhurried Monkish dissonances. Mosking (also a Dinosaur single release) is a jubilant jig inspired by Norwegian piano trio Moskus. And the classic-Ellingtonian sound of Billy Strayhorns languidly slow-swinging Absinthe (the only cover) is tweaked by the most sparing of spacey synth tones from the otherwise unplugged Galvin. Blues and gospel colours seep through the later stages of Jurds jazziest Dinosaur album, but this is an open-handed celebration of jazzs century of eloquence and influence, not its trade secrets.  Out on 15 May.

Records), an ingeniously contrapuntal repertoire for a septet that sounds twice the size, informed by composers from Maria Schneider to Avishai Cohen, and never forbiddingly intricate. And the ever iconoclastic African-American pianist and Cecil Taylor heir Matthew Shipp celebrates his 60th birthday with The Piano Equation (Tao Forms), a typically densely layered and sometimes inscrutable solo venture that, like all Shipps work, repays more than a nonchalant listen.","402"

Pandemic thrillers, online horrors, dystopian sci fi  these can all teach us what we need to know, right?   Related: My streaming gem: why you should watch The Killing of America   Maybe, maybe not. When the real-life news is vastly more consequential than anything the cinema can cook up, surely it is time to dive into the past. Nothing bad ever happened then, did it? As it turns out, the wastelands of pre-1970 Netflix mean theres little material to go on. I would have tried My Man Godfrey if Pamela Hutchinson hadnt got there first. But whats this? Not one, but two brilliant Edward G Robinson film noirs from his late-1940s golden period: The Stranger and The Woman in the Window. This was when Robinson was at the top of his game, exuding a world-weary righteousness in Double Indemnity and playing the sap in a pair of outstanding Fritz Lang tragedies, of which Woman in the Window is one. (The other, Scarlet Street, was a remake of Jean Renoirs first film, La Chienne.) The Stranger, perhaps, is the more interesting film, and ties into Robinsons own off-screen life. Though his beaten-up mug was to be seen numerous times in the first part of his acting career as a hoodlum or villain  most notoriously in Little Caesar, the 1931 role that put him on the map  Robinson was in fact a sensitive, art-collecting, anti-fascist of the old school, whose family escaped antisemitic riots in Romania, sailing to New York when Robinson (then plain Manny Goldenberg) was 10 years old. He donated a quarter of a million of 1940s dollars to charitable causes during and after the second world war, and even though he aired his disgust of communism as he named names at the Huac hearings, had his career derailed in the 1950s by an unofficial political greylisting.    In The Stranger he distils all that in his role as UN investigator Wilson, working a complicated bait-and-switch by releasing a Nazi minion called Meineke, in the hope that he will lead him to the big fish: Franz Kindler, who is posited by the film as the designer of the final solution  the most brilliant of the younger minds of the Nazi party  who conceived the theory of genocide. Kindler, of course, is played by Orson Welles, rather more plausible (if we are being honest) as the raffish schoolteacher Kindler is aiming to pass himself off as than an Eichmannesque architect of the death of millions. Another part of The Strangers allure is that its a pit-stop in Welless relatively brief Hollywood career, an attempt to rebuild his profile after the savaging that RKO had inflicted on The Magnificent Ambersons. It was his third credited directing job (though purists might also include Journey into Fear) and appears to suggest Welles was in relatively contrite mode, trying to prove he could make a straightforward studio picture on time and on budget. Well, as it turned out, The Stranger is the closest Welles ever got to a bona fide commercial hit (to paraphrase Alan Partridge, it was only the film Citizen Kane could have been). Reports suggest that Welles was largely powerless in the face of Universals supercutter Ernest Nims, the studio editor who Welles described as his nemesis. Well, even so, The Stranger has a lot of great stuff in it, from the down-home checkers obsessively manning the till at the local cafe, to the gloriously shadowy photography courtesy of Russell Metty (who would work on Welless even more extravagant Touch of Evil a decade later). Welles even contrives a suitably noir-gimmick ending, atop a very rickety ladder, where Kindler is stabbed to death by the moving figure of a Teutonic-looking medieval swordsman on his beloved clock. (Oh, the irony.) The rather sketchy nature of what Kindler is accused of shows that the grim details of the Holocaust had yet to percolate very far into American culture, though Welles did make a point of including a brief series of vrit documentary shots of concentration camps to provide what would now be called a teachable moment. However, The Stranger, principally, brings home the enduring theme of noir: the devastation that the second world war wreaked on the American psyche, and the silent nastiness that proliferated behind the white picket fence. (Nothing new, of course, if you were African American or First Nation.) Unearthing a war criminal as he marries into the family of a supreme court justice is a fairly uncomplicated deployment of the motif  but in these dislocated times its a reminder that once the American establishment took exception to Nazis. Somehow that seems a long time ago.  The Stranger is available on Amazon Prime and Netflix in the UK and US ","800"

A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a resort deck featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side  known as the Magic Carpet  to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ships restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port.
Its really scary, you dont know how long its going to last, says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. When I called medical and said, can you get me some medicine, my head is going to explode, they said, there are people sicker than you, stay where you are.
She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April, alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers, despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide.

The ship is not an exception. Across the world, a Guardian investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew.
Nedeltcheva, who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria, may have been one of the lucky ones.
Upwards of 100,000 other crew members  including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex  remain trapped on their ships.
Most have no communication with the outside world, and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the Guardians investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai.
The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, according to a recording of the captains announcement obtained by Business Insider.

In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee given to the Miami Herald.
Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinitys shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ships medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms.
The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships havent suffered higher infection rates than those on land.
A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: We have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.
The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected, but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships.
This accounts for 0.06% of confirmed cases globally, said the association in a statement. It is hard to tell how many of those confirmed cases are crew members, as we are still in the process of collecting that information as well.

Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem, given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases. Another cruise ship, the Ruby Princess, which is blamed for spreading the disease around Australia in March, has now surpassed the Diamond Princess in the scale of its deadly outbreak  21 people died and 900 were infected aboard the ship.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified cruise ships as being global spreaders of coronavirus.
Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries, said a 4 April CDC order, barring those leaving cruise ships from taking any commercial flights in the US. Outbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage.
Most ships have only one doctor and a few nurses for thousands of passengers and crew, workers say The ships generally rely on hospitals on shore for urgent care. Because of the pandemic, however, the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases.
They are basically getting no healthcare, says Michael Winkleman, the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. They are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call, no one comes.
Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, are headquartered in the US, the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia, meaning they pay almost no US taxes.
Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which allows them to avoid strict safety standards, labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US.





A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owners own.
For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.
For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers' Federation.
Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an open registry, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.
The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.
Karen McVeigh, senior reporter





US Coast Guard officials said in a memo on 29 March that outbreaks aboard ships are straining the rescue and medical resources in the Florida region. The bulletin, first obtained by the Miami Herald, asked ships carrying more than 50 people to prepare to provide their own medical care to those onboard for extended periods.
Foreign-flagged ships that loiter beyond US territorial seas, particularly those registered in the Bahamas should seek assistance from the countries where they are flagged, it added.

Officials in the Bahamas responded with their own memo, saying the medical system of the tiny Caribbean island nation would be overwhelmed if it had to take on caring for all those sick aboard cruise ships.
The cruise industry is facing an unprecedented crisis, and we in the Bahamas, facing the same global crisis, are doing what we can to provide support, said the statement by the ministry of transport and local government. Our system is not designed to deal with a massive influx of new Covid-19 patients from outside our country.
On some ships, crew members say they are being treated well, and some have been moved to passenger cabins with balconies and more space in which to spend their quarantine. Crew on the Celebrity Serenade made a parody video of their time confined to their cabins at sea. Some reported getting bonuses from their cruise lines. The Celebrity Edge, currently floating in the Bahamas, distributed a video of the ships captain delivering meals to the rooms of quarantined workers.
On other ships, the situation is dire. Workers have complained that food seemed to be running out, and that they were forced to pay for internet time.
Many crew have had their pay cut off entirely. Workers on board several ships run by the Geneva-based MSC cruise line, according to letters from MSC seen by the Guardian, are no longer being paid after their contracts ran out or were terminated early by the company because of the global pandemic. 
A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships operations. We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge, assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use.
A former crew member for another major cruise liner, Krista Thomas, who lives in Vancouver, has been running a private Facebook group to update crew members at sea about how to get home.
She says many crew are scared to speak out. They depend on the cruise industry for livelihoods, and cruise ship pay  while low compared to average wages in many developed countries  is often many times higher than what they can earn at home.
Theyre probably not just taking care of a wife and kids; theyre taking care of parents and in-laws, says Thomas. They are living contract to contract to get by  They dont want to tear the industry down. It has taken a huge hit because of whats happened and they dont want to see their industry fall apart.
Ross Klein, who has written books criticising the cruise industry and runs a website that reports incidents involving cruises, says crew members from developing countries are in as close to indentured servitude as it gets. He argues that the cruise companies bear a responsibility to care for them.
The workers are powerless, he says. The employers have a moral and ethical duty to care for these people they brought from around the world. There have got to be ways to work out a solution to get these people safely home.

She still worries about her friends aboard the Celebrity Apex in Saint-Nazaire in France. There, as of 14 April, two workers remained hospitalised with severe Covid-19 and 700 crew were still working or isolating, according to a report by a French TV station.

Solutions
1:A - From left to right, the painting shows apples being harvested, loaded on to a cart, put through a cider press, and stored in barrels. Formerly catalogued as by an unknown Flemish artist, the painting was conserved and reattributed in 2019. It is now thought to combine a landscape by Joos de Momper the Younger (1564-1635) with figures by the workshop of Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625). Flemish artists often specialised in particular types of painting and collaborations of this kind were common.

Photo: Simon Gillespie Studio, 2:B - Claudes biographer Joachim von Sandrart records that the artist trained as a pastry cook in his native France. He spent most of his subsequent artistic career in Rome, becoming famous for his harmonious classical landscapes. This view shows one of his favourite subjects, the Ponte Molle, a bridge across the River Tiber to the north of Rome. Image: Landscape Near Rome With a View of the Ponte Molle (1645) by Claude Lorrain (1604-82), Birmingham Museums Trust, 3:B - Henry Stacy Marks began his career painting subjects from history and literature, especially scenes from Shakespeares plays. However, he became best known for his humorous and characterful paintings of birds. Marks prided himself on the accuracy of his bird paintings, and enjoyed regular sketching trips to London Zoo. This painting shows a group of Humboldt penguins clustering and preening on a rock. Image: Dominicans in Feathers (1880-87) by Henry Stacy Marks (1829-98), Birmingham Museums Trust, 4:D - In the first version of this composition, completed in 1870, the dove is red and carries a white poppy. Birminghams later variation was begun in 1877 but was unresolved when Rossetti gave it to his sister-in-law, the artist and writer Lucy Madox Brown. The picture was completed after Rossettis death by her father, the pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown. Image: Beata Beatrix (1877) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-88), Birmingham Museums Trust, 5:A - The lines are taken from Christina Rossettis poem, A Bird Song. The picture contrasts the lush green of the summer landscape with the grief of the woman in mourning for a relative killed in the war. Image: The Boer War (1900-01) by Byam Shaw (1872-1919), Birmingham Museums Trust, 6:D - Walton travelled widely in Europe, Scandinavia and the Middle East, but is best known for his paintings and watercolours of the Alps. Birminghams collection includes a selection of Waltons works together with his passport. Image: Alpine Climbers (1869) by Elijah Walton (1832-80), Birmingham Museums Trust, 7:B - Born in Pittsburgh, Mary Cassatt began studying art in Philadelphia at the age of 16. She travelled extensively in Europe before settling in Paris in 1874. Birminghams portrait is one of only two oil paintings by the artist in UK public collections: the other is in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow. Image: Portrait of a Woman (1881-83) by Mary Cassatt (1844-1926), Birmingham Museums Trust, 8:C - A scallop shell and staff are traditional emblems of pilgrimage. They are particularly associated with pilgrims to the shrine of St James the Great at Santiago de Compostela in north-west Spain. Bunce's painting is inspired by a poem by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, The Staff and Scrip (a name for the pilgrim's bag).

Losing everything on the 6.30 at Goodwood led him to the brink of ending his life and, ultimately, to seek help for a crippling addiction that put paid to his promising career as a professional footballer. It was 8 June 2015, he says, with total recall. For the first time in my life I got scared and that was when I first reached out to my parents. In nine years he lost about 250,000, plus 50,000 of his parents money, after gambling 80-90% of his wages. These days, he educates players about the dangers of gambling on behalf of Epic risk management, gambling harm-minimisation consultants.   Related: Revealed: the dire consequences of footballs relationship with gambling   The latest Gambling Commission report found 0.5% of people aged 16 and above are classified as problem gamblers but data collected by Epic from every EFL club across 2018-19 identified 7.2% of first-team players as potentially problem gamblers: people who have an urge to gamble continuously despite harmful consequences. This month the PFA reported a rise in players accessing mental health support, with its director of player welfare, Michael Bennett, concerned about an increase in players gambling because of coronavirus. The global players union, Fifpro, announced the percentage of players reporting symptoms of depression had doubled since the shutdown. Last week a player confided to Davies his recent struggles. He said he was missing the changing-room banter and bravado, and that he doesnt have much to turn to in terms of support because he lives by himself. He had been off gambling for a few months and thought he was in control of it but this [pandemic] has set him off again. The recent figures dont surprise me, sadly, but the only slight satisfaction is that players are reaching out. Suffering in silence is the worst thing you can do.    Scott Davies in action for Reading against Nottingham Forest in August 2009. Photograph: Javier Garca/Rex/Shutterstock   Davies, funded by the PFA, spent 26 days in rehabilitation at a Sporting Chance clinic and understands the temptation facing players. If I had to go through this now, I would try to make ends meet by gambling. If someone asked me to take a 30% pay cut in the height of my addiction, when I was earning a couple of thousand a week at Crawley, I would think: Ill try and win that 30% back. That is a vicious circle because, as a gambling addict, youre out of control and reckless with your behaviour. Its a recipe for disaster. The absence of routine can also pose problems. As a professional footballer you get told what time to be at the training ground, what time training is starting, what time to have breakfast, what time youre going to finish and, basically, youre mollycoddled  Now when you get up in the morning, you might go for a run or do some exercise but that will only last for an hour or so, so what do you do to get that buzz, that rush of scoring a goal? How do you replicate that? Gambling is often the one people turn to. Sportspeople are competitive and want instant gratification  People are scratching around trying to bet on other avenues in online betting systems, and thats a danger in itself, be it slot machines, blackjack or roulette, which are dangerous because its just numbers on a screen  not hard cash. Its not until you check your bank account that you realise how much you have lost.    Scott Davies playing for Wycombe in 2009. Photograph: Lee Mills/Rex/Shutterstock   At present Davies is limited to virtual sessions but continues to educate EFL players and staff to ensure they understand potential gambling risks, rules around betting integrity and how to look for signs of potential harm. A common trend is experienced players dropping down the leagues and trying to finance a champagne lifestyle on lemonade money. After a workshop at a Championship club last year, Davies says a high-profile player revealed he had a gambling problem. He looked like a picture of health and wealth; he was wearing a gold Rolex and dripping in Gucci, but it just shows you dont know who is struggling. You can hide it quite well. Eight years ago Davies crashed into a car close to home because he was watching horse racing on his phone. I said: Sorry, Ive fallen asleep at the wheel, I play football, Ive had a double session today. I looked and there was a kid sat in the car seat in the back and for the first time in my life I felt guilty about what I was doing. I thought: Im bringing other peoples lives into danger. But I didnt know how to stop, how to end this pain I was going through. I gave the driver 500 that I had stuffed away in my car  money I had won that day. I drove home and cried myself to sleep. That was a massive wake-up call.   I used to sleep in my car because I would rather put 20 in a slot machine than buy petrol   Davies began betting at 16, while earning 50 a week at Reading, and sometimes walked four miles from his digs to training because he could not afford the 1.20 bus fare. From there, his addiction spiralled from playing poker on the Aldershot team bus to haemorrhaging his 30,000 signing-on fee at Crawley inside three weeks. There were times when I used to sleep in my car after training because I couldnt afford to get home. I would rather put my last 20 in a roulette machine, in the hope of turning it into a few hundred, than towards fuel to make sure I got home safe that night. Once after a game I slept at a service station and woke up in the freezing cold thinking: What has my life become?   The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.   In 2009 he impressed Brendan Rodgers during pre-season at Reading and was given his Championship debut aged 21. Davies was highly rated, but his addiction consumed him. I was sneaking out of training when players were doing extra and I got pulled into the managers office and told to be more professional. I was always the last into training and the first out because I had a date every day and that was with the bookmakers; it was all I thought about. The following day I got caught sneaking out of training again. When I got pulled into his office I told him I had a dentist appointment and that was the reason I had to shoot off. I knew deep down I was lying to him but I didnt want to show a sign of weakness and say: Listen, Im struggling with gambling addiction. I never played another minute for Reading and thats one of the things I have to deal with every day now. If I think back to how I was doing, it hurts. Davies, who had spells at Oxford and Wycombe, now plays for Slough Town. For me, its not so much about the money Ive lost, he says, but probably about the career I should have had.

"2020-05-01T07:00:17Z","commentisfree","Opinion","A cavalier Tory leader and a botched pandemic response? It must be 1957","Harold Macmillan was British prime minister from 1957 to 1963. A charming Tory with a patchy record, hes usually remembered for saying that during his government Britons had never had it so good in their standard of living. What has been forgotten, almost completely, is that he said this in the middle of a pandemic. Macmillan made his claim on 20 July 1957, at a party rally in Bedford. Like Boris Johnson, he was a new premier with a preference for optimistic public statements. In 1957, the British economy was actually quite fragile, and Macmillan acknowledged this in his speech, but the idea that Tory rule kept Britain prosperous and safe was central to his premiership. As now, the party had already been in power for years, and needed to present a Labour government as a terrible risk. The pandemic, of a new strain of flu, had started in China the previous winter. During the first half of 1957 it steadily moved across Asia and then the rest of the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, to the alarm of the worlds media, including the British press. In June, the first cases appeared in Britain. Yet that month, and again in July, Macmillans health secretary, Dennis Vosper, refused to make a public statement setting out the threat the flu posed, arguing that it was not spreading in the UK.   Related: Lack of logic in Boris Johnsons claims on lockdown and coronavirus peak | Letters   By August, the virus was all over north-west England. Macmillan finally began to pay attention. He asked another health minister, John Vaughan-Morgan, for his departments view of the situation. Vaughan-Morgan replied: The general assessment seems to be that eventually [the flu] will affect up to 20% of the population. But he insisted that the virus was more a public relations than a medical problem: This is a heaven-sent topic for the press during the silly season. The government advised those with symptoms to stay at home, but otherwise took little national action as the flu spread right across the country during the autumn, instead leaving it to local medical officials to work out what to do. In some areas, schools were closed, but few sporting events or other mass gatherings were cancelled. In October, the peak of the outbreak in Britain, the Conservative party conference went ahead as usual. Macmillans speech didnt mention the pandemic. The outbreak continued into the winter, and ultimately may have killed more than 30,000 Britons. Senior medical figures were horrified at Britains performance. John Corbett McDonald of the public health laboratory service wrote to Ian Watson of the Royal College of General Practitioners: Although we have had [over] 30 years to prepare for what should be done in the event of an influenza pandemic  since the previous one in 1918  we have all been rushing around trying to improvise [solutions]. We can only hope that  at the end it may be possible to construct an adequate explanation of what happened.   Related: The language that disguises the governments failings on coronavirus | Letters   Many critics of Johnson over coronavirus are hoping for a similar reckoning. The government is expecting one, too, judging by its goalpost-shifting rhetoric, such as the prime ministers highly selective boast this week that Britain had defied so many predictions about the impact of the virus. But for Johnsons critics, the fate of Macmillans government in the aftermath of the 1957 pandemic is not a reassuring precedent. During the later months of the crisis  not a point the government has reached yet  the Tories poll ratings did fall sharply. But by the time the next general election came, in 1959, the pandemic had receded. The Labour manifesto didnt even raise the governments handling of it. The Conservatives talked up their economic record instead, and won easily, increasing their Commons majority to 100. In Britain, it remains disconcertingly easy  and a sign of how lopsided our democracy is  for Tory governments responsible for disasters to change the subject. The rightwing bias of the press, worse now than in the 1950s, as there are fewer left-leaning papers, is the obvious villain. But equally important is a reluctance from voters to face up to the sheer scale of what the Conservatives have sometimes got wrong. The 1957 flu catastrophe came the year after the disastrous British military intervention at Suez  also under the Conservatives, and supported by Macmillan  which destroyed much of Britains credibility as a world power. Similarly, the British coronavirus failure closely follows the Tories chaotic Brexit U-turns and hugely counterproductive austerity. Yet in both eras, many voters have avoided coming to the unsettling conclusion that, quite often, their default ruling class simply isnt up to the job. Its more comforting to believe, as Johnson promised this week, that after its latest calamity, the UK will emerge stronger than ever before. Our national myth often revolves around recovery from disaster. In this narrative, failures by the state  such as the second world war setbacks that led to Dunkirk  just create opportunities for future, greater successes. As a politician preoccupied by history, and not very good at governing, Johnson understands this well. His much-admired optimism is really a form of cynicism: as he blunders through the present, he keeps the possibility of better times for Britain in the future floating perpetually in the distance, like a mirage. Can the Tories cynical optimism and evasions of responsibility ever be effectively pointed out? They can if Labour has a sharp enough leader. In 1957, Macmillan was mocked in parliament for his never had it so good speech by the shadow chancellor. With deft sarcasm, Harold Wilson called the speech remarkable. Wilson became Labour leader in 1963, as Macmillans supposed economic miracle finally petered out, and won four of the next five elections. Keir Starmer might do well to get some old tapes of him out.  Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist","971"

Gordon Ramsay, Gino DAcampo and I travelled across the US in September  it was such an epic and emotional adventure. It is so lovely to relive those moments now. It is even more special because, with lockdown, we cant go back on another adventure. It really was the trip of a lifetime. There were so many moments that didnt make it into the show, but out of the ones I remember most fondly there was a day when we went and did goat yoga, which was really surreal and fun. We all laughed until the cows came home. I also remember visiting Gordons mum when we competed at her house to make a burger and, of course, out of the three of us, Gordon won. I think she chose him because she wanted to see me and Gino naked in the pool  which was the forfeit for losing. What was really interesting to me was seeing the restaurant scene across the US and how they do things very differently from us here, especially in San Francisco.

Id love to go out and film another season and visit new places, but I think itll be a while before we can do that. Ive never been to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia or Vietnam, so they would be incredible to visit. Id also love to go back to South America, where I travelled when I was younger. Ive been keeping busy, though, with a bit of work. I have also been exercising every day, doing a lot of cooking and playing with my kids. Im also speaking almost every week with Gordon and Gino during the lockdown. Its difficult for everyone at the moment but its also difficult on different levels. We all have to be thankful for what we have; when I flush my toilet or have a shower, Im so grateful I have that level of luxury and can also put food on the table when there are people queueing up for food banks. Were all in this together and we have to be disciplined to try to do the right thing so that more dont suffer.

Parts of the Australian alps that were devastated by the summers bushfire crisis were blanketed with early falls. More than 20cm fell at Thredbo and surrounding mountains in two days, with more forecast. The Bureau of Meteorology recorded 180mm of precipitation at the resort, which spent the first few weeks of 2020 with bushfires raging on three sides.







But the snow has fallen on an empty resort, with national parks in New South Wales and Victoria shut due to the coronavirus.
The heavy snowfall comes three weeks before the resort recorded a similar dump last year, with 25cm falling on 27 May. The 2019 season also saw 10cm fall on 1 April, and a spokeswoman from the resort said it was not uncommon to receive early season snowfall before the NSW ski season officially opens in mid-June.

Perisher ski resort, which is north of Thredbo in the Snowy Mountains, has recorded 16cm of fresh snow, with 131mm in the bureaus rain gauge.
Selwyn Snow Resort, which was destroyed by the fires along with the abandoned mining village of Kiandra, received 13cm of snow.
Across the border in Victoria, the historic Mount Buffalo chalet was doused in pink fire retardant and surrounded by sprinklers as a fire raced up the side of the mountain over summer.
On Friday morning, Mount Buffalos ski fields, which are higher up the mountain than the chalet, had 16cm of fresh snow. David Chitty, who runs the Mount Buffalo ski school, had to content himself to watching it via the snow camera as the Mount Buffalo and Alpine national parks remain closed.
Falls Creek had 20cm of snow, with another 10cm forecast to fall, and Mount Hotham had 16cm.

The ski season does not officially open until the Queens Birthday weekend, on 8 June. Falls Creek ski resort has still pencilled in opening night fireworks but the rest of its events calendar is blank.
National parks in Victoria and New South Wales remain closed, and residents are still not allowed to travel for non-essential reasons. Queensland, Western Australia and the NT have opened national parks this week, and some are allowing fishing and camping and other outdoor sports.
It could mean that alpine towns such as Bright, Thredbo and Jindabyne miss out on their second-busiest season of the year, having lost the summer to bushfires and Easter to the coronavirus shutdown.

Chitty said he was hopeful that restrictions may be eased.

The no-frills airline said it was cutting 15% of its 20,000-strong workforce as it did not expect passenger numbers or pricing to return to pre-coronavirus levels until summer 2022 at the earliest. As part of a programme of sweeping cost cuts, Ryanair said it could close a number of bases across Europe until air travel recovers. The chief executive, Michael OLeary, took a 50% pay cut for April and May and has now extended this until the end of March next year. OLeary said the package of measures, which include unpaid leave for staff, represented the minimum to survive the next 12 months. He told the BBC: If a vaccine isnt found then clearly we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts into the future.  The company, which expects to report a net loss of more than 100m (87m) for the first quarter and through the summer, said restructuring and job losses would start in July. The job cuts will affect mostly pilots and cabin crew, although the measures will also hit head office and back office teams.    The company said: Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years  [We] will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss programme. It said it would operate less than 1% of its scheduled flights to the end of June, with passenger numbers down 99.5% in the first quarter and halved in the second quarter, but should return to meaningful flying from July. It expects to carry fewer than 100 million passengers for the year to the end of March 2021, 35% less than its original target of 154 million. Ryanair is in talks with Boeing and Airbus to reduce aircraft orders over the next two years to more accurately reflect a slower and more distorted EU air travel market in a post-Covid-19 world. OLeary launched a broadside at the 30bn in state aid packages accepted by rival airlines across Europe, arguing that Ryanair would struggle to compete without a level playing field. Air France and Lufthansa are subsidy junkies hoovering up state aid, he saidon BBC Radio 4s Today programme. We support transparent non-discriminatory schemes like payroll support. Why does Lufthansa need another 12bn on top of that? It means that for the next three to five years they can engage in below-cost selling. We face unfair competition against legacy airlines in Europe getting unfair state aid. Ryanair said it intended to challenge the state aid awards in European courts.  OLeary also addressed complaints from customers about the difficulty in getting refunds for cancelled flights. The airline is offering vouchers in the first instance. If you want a cash refund you will get a cash refund, he said. We will give you your money back. Nobody has to fight for a refund from Ryanair. OLeary said the issue was not Ryanair being obstructive but the sheer weight of refund requests slowing the system while staff numbers were reduced.    He said the airline would normally process 10,000 claims a month but was currently dealing with a backlog of 25m, covering cancellations from March to May. OLeary said the business was working through March refunds, which could take two or three months to complete. He said customers who required refunds for flights in May would have to wait four to six months.","591"

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, had said earlier on Friday it would be a matter for state jurisdictions to clear any resumption of sporting activities, following a meeting of the national cabinet. Palaszczuk not only gave the green light for the states three NRL clubs to train at their base and travel interstate but also host home games.   Related: When will community sports resume as Australia moves out of Covid-19 restrictions?   I said I was as keen as anyone else to see the NRL return and I meant it, Palaszczuk said. The only condition was that it did not put our excellent work containing the spread of Covid-19 at risk and the chief health officer advises that the NRL plan is workable. But the New Zealand-based Warriors have not yet been given clearance to travel to Australia, ahead of the planned return to training on Monday and a season resumption on 28 May. No amount of reporting would change that, Morrison said, after the Nine Network had reported earlier in the day that the national cabinet had approved the Warriors to fly into Tamworth on Sunday. A decision on that will be made on the basis of assessment by the Australian Border Force, which is ongoing. When theyre in a position to authorise it, they will, Morrison said. The NSW state government has also yet to grant exemption for the Warriors to train as a group should they spend two weeks in quarantine. But league officials remain confident those exemptions will be secured in time for the team to be in the country by next week. The Warriors will be on the plane, the ARL Commission chairman, Peter Vlandys, told AAP on Friday. I clarified all those matters. Ill have it in writing to them once I get all the border security and state government approvals. The Warriors just wanted clarity on a few things and now they have got that they are fully supportive. Vlandys had spoken with Warriors players amid fears of a player revolt as they unified to address concerns about relocating.

Families of Warriors players will remain in New Zealand for now, although the league is hopeful border restrictions will eventually ease. Players across all clubs will return to their bases on Monday for a briefing on biosecurity laws, however they have yet to commit to a return to training. Fridays cabinet meeting also set a range of principles for the broader resumption of sport and recreation activities, from professional leagues to grassroots competition. The principles draw heavily on the Australian Institute of Sports framework for rebooting sport across the country, Morrison said, and spoke to the need for community sport to be moving. According to the principles, any return to the playing field should not compromise the health of individuals or the community. It will be based on objective health information and introduced in a phased fashion, initially for small groups of less than 10 people in a non-contact way.

Thousands of workers, many of them undocumented, live in settlements between huge greenhouses on farms in the southern Spanish provinces of Huelva and Almeria, key regions for European supply chains.   Related: Rape and abuse: the price of a job in Spains strawberry industry?   Local union activists have been supporting the migrants, bringing them water, food and basic supplies since Spain declared a lockdown in mid March. Clare Carlile from Ethical Consumer, a UK UK campaign organisation crowdfunding to support the local activists, says the situation is the result of years of neglect of workers. They got visited by the Spanish army on the 18th of March and told to stay put, even though in some places running water is several kilometres away. Now, with Covid fears, a water truck comes twice a week. If you are at work and miss it you must walk several kilometres for water after a hard day. Failure of employers provide basic rights has for years created dire circumstances for the inhabitants of the settlements. Now, the pandemic has pushed the situation to crisis point. The workers fear they are unprotected against the virus, both in the unhygienic settlements and when working side-by-side on the farms.    Migrant day labourers wait for employers to pick them up to collect fruit near Lepe, Huelva. Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP via Getty Images   Amadou, who is from Mali, is a member of the Collective of African Workers, a grassroots organisation campaigning for an end to the shanty towns in Lepe settlement, Huelva province. Were living here, feeling scared and afraid, because up until now we havent received any kind of help, not in terms of water, gloves, or face masks, Amadou told Ethical Consumer. Soc-sat, the local agricultural union, is providing food, soap, medicine and nappies for babies in settlements in Almeria and Huelva, while groups say promises have been made by the local state but have not yet materialised. The Guardian has repeatedly reported on dire and sometimes exploitative conditions in the fruit and vegetable picking regions of southern Spain that supply berries and salad to supermarkets across Europe.   Related: Rape and abuse: the price of a job in Spains strawberry industry?   Spain is the main fruit and vegetables producer in the EU. Around half of the goods  from salad picked in greenhouses to citrus fruits  are for the export market. Nearly all, 93%, goes to the EU market: Germany France, the UK. The regions of Huelva and Almeria, where migrants are now struggling under lockdown, are key parts of this cross-Europe supply chain. Huelva is where 97% of the Spanish berry crop is grown; in Almeria, workers producer around 35% of Spains total fruit and vegetable exports. Last month Philip Alston, the UN Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, visited Spain; his report was highly critical of the conditions for migrant workers in Huelva. I visited areas I suspect many Spaniards would not recognise as a part of their country, Alston said. In Huelva, I met with workers living in a migrant settlement in conditions that rival the worst I have seen anywhere in the world. They are kilometres away from water, and live without electricity or adequate sanitation. Many have lived there for years and can afford to pay rent, but said no one will accept them as tenants. They are earning as little as 30 (26) per day  In 2018-19 the strawberry crop in Huelva was worth 533 million euros. Recent weeks have seen concerns across Europe that supply chains will falter under the pressure of increased consumer demand and more difficult working conditions. The estimated third of the workforce of migrant farm labour who do not have the legal right to work have faced many difficulties under lockdown. Last week a coalition of 27 NGOS called for regularisation of migrant farm workers as well as proper protection from Covid-19.    The migrant settlements do not have running water, electricity or adequate sanitation. Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP via Getty Images   One of the charities, Caritas, said: The Covid-19 crisis and lockdown measures are  putting the spotlight on how acutely the EUs agricultural system depends on migrant workers. Now that many of them have returned to their home countries, or cannot access the fields due to travel restrictions, vast amounts of fruits and vegetables are at risk of being left unpicked. In the fields and in many food-processing plants, labourers toil close to one another with no protective equipment. We call on states to ensure that migrant workers ... are provided with decent working conditions and granted immediate legal papers to remain. Spain will lift the lockdown in the coming weeks but activists say the situation is still dangerous for vulnerable workers, with lack of water and workplace protection putting workers at ongoing risk of further Covid-19 outbreaks.

My grandmother, at home with 10 children between the wars, took in sailors washing to make ends meet. She had no schooling after the age of 12 and remained a housewife, dependent on my grandfather. In the 1950s my mother, a school-leaver at 14, worked part-time while her three kids were small, then full-time in the accounts office of a big department store. In the 1970s my older sister left home, trained as a teacher, married and also had three children. She retired a headteacher on a professional pension; her life was poles apart from my grandmothers. Yet all three women led double lives, fitting their paid jobs around housework and childcare. Their labour was also typically female. Laundry work such as charing or cleaning has been a perennial standby for the poorest women in society. Girls like my mother, with some schooling, turned to the factory, shop or office work; those with more qualifications have been ushered into the caring professions such as nursing and, above all, teaching. There are no typical lives, Helen McCarthy writes in her impressive and nuanced study. Each is unique. But the best history writing, like hers, shows how representative the individual life is. Double Lives begins in the mid-19th century, but its vantage point is very much that of the present. Three quarters of British mothers now work, an astonishing shift from the Victorian era. And a mothers desire to earn independently is largely viewed as legitimate. Yet despite this cultural sea change, and despite inroads made into all the professions, the majority of working mothers are in low-paid, insecure jobs with rigid hours and no childcare. Just as their Victorian predecessors finished garments or glued matchboxes, todays home-workers make baby slipper-socks or attach crystals to greetings cards.    The component assembly room at Ferrantis radio works, Moston, Merseyside, in 1935. Photograph: Daily Herald Archive/SSPL/Getty Images   Well into the 20th century the majority of British men and women, including most feminists and womens organisations, argued that motherhood was a womans prime vocation. Women entering the professions felt they must choose between mothering or a career. The good mother only worked because she had to. A deserted wife, a widow or a lone parent was to be pitied. The bad mother worked because she wanted to. How much, McCarthy asks, has changed? The ideal of the male breadwinner, always able to earn enough to keep wife and children at home, no longer holds sway. But todays employers and policymakers still mostly assume the worker to be male. Social welfare provision all too often merges the needs of the mother and child and sees the wife as dependent on her husband. The home is still imagined to be the mothers  not the fathers  place. McCarthys is an economic and social history, but she also wants to give shade and texture to what has been thought and said about working mothers. In this she succeeds magnificently. She is as much at home with popular novels and journalism as she is with cabinet memos, parliamentary commissions, employment law, or sociological reports. She never treats her sources as gospel, neatly characterising much early social investigation into the lives of the poor as a genre-crossing blend of statistics and sentiment, empiricism and emotionalism. And always the voices of working mothers are raised above the cacophony of official and unofficial commentary. The worst-off women were never simply victims. While the majority certainly worked from economic necessity, they could also enjoy their jobs. Home-workers were often proud of their skills. Industrial employees relished the camaraderie and the taste of freedom. One young mother in a Midlands jam factory met with disapproval from a female inspector when she confessed she would hate to stay at ome all dye to mind the blessed byby  it ud give me the bloomin ump! She spoke for many in the decades to come.   Part-timers often found themselves without any chance of promotion, refused sick pay and holiday entitlement   Double Lives sometimes reads haltingly as it hedges its arguments. The early 20th century saw droves of women take up clerical work, but new marriage bars limited their prospects. Wartime administrations called up mothers for their reserve army of labour, focusing on their needs and even providing workplace nurseries, but only for the duration. Part-time work expanded enormously after the second world war, thanks to a consumer boom, but employers used its temporary nature to justify unequal pay. Treated as a stopgap between matrimony and childbearing, or as extra housekeeping for the older mother returning to work, part-timers often found themselves without any chance of promotion, refused sick pay and holiday entitlement. Two steps forward, one step back. In the long run, though, the figure of the working mother became more ordinary and acceptable. McCarthy writes with calm authority. But she is not neutral. The narrowly conformist 50s come in for particular criticism. Yet in that decade far more mothers, like my own, found satisfaction in working outside the home. Double Lives is dubious about theories of maternal deprivation, such as John Bowlbys or Donald Winnicotts, which have so often been used as a stick to beat working mothers. A history of childhood experience would obviously be a different book; McCarthys few retrospective testimonies leave the issue wide open.    Since 1945, governments have invested in nursery schools. Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian   In the postwar decades a second income became a source of pride and prosperity. Higher aspirations were inextricably linked to consumerism, on spending for the home and on leisure. Todays two income families have inherited the assumption that personal fulfilment is linked to buying and having more. Families have shrunk in size since reliable contraception and abortion have gradually become available  a seismic shift for many women, who are no longer subject to endless childbearing. Double Lives says little about new forms of peer pressure to have children, or the burgeoning commodification of motherhood (Mothercare, founded in 1972 and now defunct, would be a case in point). McCarthys final chapters chronicle recent advances  in employment law, pay battles, and anti-discrimination policies. More working mothers than ever find self-esteem and economic independence in many more walks of life. They speak out more in public and they are listened to. But still they are guilt-ridden and often exhausted. While the media has amplified and distorted debates about the selfish mother, the women who work too hard, and those who want to have it all, the competitive individualism of many professional workplaces is hardly feminist, let alone enjoyable. The language of professionalisation gives women status but reproduces male corporate models of marketisation (McCarthy, a historian at Cambridge, briefly refers to her line-manager). So-called empowerment comes at the expense of an underclass of other women doing the housework, the majority of them black or from ethnic minorities. Men havent shifted that much into domesticity or childcare. And in some communities husbands still prefer their wives not to work. At different times both Labour and Conservative administrations after 1945 invested in maternity services and nursery education. McCarthy argues that despite ideological differences, governments have gone on viewing the interests of women and families as one and the same thing. In the 70s feminists critiqued the family for shoring up the housewifes role and for enshrining children as possessions. Fewer of us now live in conventional families, but the rhetoric of the family, preferably hard-working, is still constantly deployed. As the cornerstone of conservative visions of social life, the family remains idealised. During the current pandemic, as so often in past crises, women, and especially mothers, are being asked to shore up this fantasy while working twice as hard.

Mishustin, Russias most-high profile Covid-19 patient so far, disclosed the diagnosis during a televised video call with President Putin on Thursday evening. It was not immediately clear how severe Mishustins symptoms are, though one news agency reported that he had an elevated temperature of 39 degrees. Putin indicated during the call that Mishustin would be taken to hospital. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia passed 100,000 on Thursday. The first deputy prime minister, Andrei Belousov, would take on Mishustins duties in his absence, Putin said. Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, I have just found out that the tests I gave for coronavirus have come back positive  Accordingly, I will go into self-isolation, fulfilling my doctors orders. This is necessary to do in order to protect my colleagues, Mishustin told Putin during the call. It is unlikely that Mishustin has been in direct contact with Putin in recent weeks. Putin has led semi-regular video calls with members of the government from his residence at Novo-Ogaryovo. He has not been pictured in public recently. In his remarks, Mishustin urged Russians to take the disease seriously and follow the difficult self-isolation rules that have been imposed by the government. Earlier this week, Putin announced that he would extend the countrys non-working days through the May holidays, including the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. Dear Mikhail Vladimirovich, what is happening to you right now can happen to anyone, Ive always said so.

The 419 iPhone SE takes the important bits of the iPhone 11  the processor and software  and shoehorns them into the body of an iPhone 8 from 2017. You get a phone design largely unchanged from the iPhone 6 of 2014, with traditional home button, but the performance and longevity of a brand new Apple phone for 310 less than an iPhone 11. Its a tantalising proposition, competing on price with a load of mid-range Android smartphones, including Googles Pixel 3a, but with top-level iPhone performance and service.    The 4.7in iPhone SE on the left next to the 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro on the right. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   The iPhone 8s design was tired in 2018 and it is no different today. The 2020 iPhone SEs 4.7in screen is tiny by todays standards but the phones body isnt, because it eschews the modern all-screen design in favour of the old large bezels and chunky chin and forehead. Simply put, theres a lot more phone than the small screen suggests. Those looking for a truly small phone such as the previous generation 4in iPhone SE will be disappointed. The dimensions and materials are an exact match for the iPhone 8. Glass front and back, aluminium sides, a Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the home button, a Lightning connector in the bottom but no headphone socket nor Face ID. At just 148g, the iPhone SE is super light  only 1g heavier than chief rival the Pixel 3a  and small by most modern metrics. The iPhone 11 is considerably bigger, at a full 12.5mm longer and 8.4mm wider, and weighing 194g.  Still the iPhone SE feels as solid and well made as other iPhones, and I can comfortably use it with one hand. The iPhone SE doesnt support 5G. Specifications  Screen: 4.7in Retina HD (LCD) (326ppi) Processor: Apple A13 Bionic RAM: 3GB Storage: 64, 128 or 256GB Operating system: iOS 13 Camera: 12MP rear camera with OIS, 7MP front-facing camera Connectivity: esim, LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, and GPS Water resistance: IP67 (1m up to 30 minutes) Dimensions: 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3mm Weight: 148g  Same top performance as an iPhone 11    The Lightning port in the bottom takes care of cabled charging, but there is wireless charging through the back too. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   The iPhone SE has the same A13 Bionic processor as the iPhone 11 and performs similarly in day-to-day usage, which is a very good thing. It means that the iPhone SE should be a top-performer for years to come. This iPhone may only cost 419, but it will beat practically everything else in raw processing power. Sadly that performance comes at the price of battery life. The iPhone SE lasts 27 hours between charges, making it from 7am on day one until 10am on day two  enough to reliably see the phone reach bedtime before needing to be plugged in. Thats one hour longer than the iPhone 8, but eight hours short of the iPhone 11. Three hours of the 27 was spent on 4G, the rest connected to wifi. The screen was on for three hours, including 30 minutes of video, plus four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos. Charging the iPhone SE with the included 5W charger is seriously slow, reaching just 55% in 60 minutes and taking two hours 45 minutes to hit 100% from zero. With the 29 18W USB-C charger and 19 USB-C to Lightning cable that ships in the box with the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone SE hits 80% in an hour and a full charge in two hours 15 minutes. Any USB-C power delivery chargers of 18W or higher will achieve the same results and can be had for one-third of the cost. The phone has standard Qi wireless charging too. Apple slows charging to a crawl above 90% meaning that its probably not worth trying to charge the iPhone SE much beyond. Its also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimisation feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% just before you need it helping to preserve it in the process. Sustainability    With the A13 processor inside, the iPhone SE will likely receive software updates for as long as the iPhone 11 meaning the phone will be safely usable for longer than practically anything else. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   Apple does not give a rated lifecycle for the iPhone SEs battery, typically 500 full-charge cycles, but it can be replaced for 49. The phone is generally repairable, with the out-of-warranty service cost being 136.44 for the screen or 276.44 for other damage. Repair specialists iFixit gave the phone a repairability score of six out of 10. The iPhone SE has 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main logic board, 100% recycled rare earth elements in is vibration motor and at least 35% recycled plastic in multiple components. Apple is also using renewable energy for final assembly of the phone, and breaks down the iPhone SEs environmental impact in its report. Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. iOS 13    The software is more or less the same as that running on the iPhone 11, except for the gestures used to control iOS, such as the Control Centre being brought up from the bottom of the screen instead of the top. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   The iPhone SE comes out of the box with iOS 13.4.1, the same version of iOS running on Apples more expensive iPhone 11 series and every other currently-supported phone. The main differences between iOS on Apples more expensive phones and the iPhone SE is simply the lack of gesture controls. Instead the iPhone SE has the same button-based controls as older phones with Touch ID. Its quite jarring and slow moving from gesture controls used on practically every modern smartphone back to a home button, but it will immediately be familiar to all those with an Apple smartphone pre-iPhone X. You get the same dark mode, enhanced quick settings and enhanced privacy options as the iPhone 11. Whats particularly notable in this mid-range price bracket is that Apple provides software support for its smartphones for far longer than most, averaging around five years from release. The best of even high-end rivals cap out at about four years, but phones in this price bracket are often supported for far less. It means you can safely use the iPhone SE for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates. Camera    Apples camera app is simple to use and generally does an admirable job of capturing photos fast and efficiently, even though it lacks any manual control. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian   The iPhone SE has a single 12-megapixel rear camera that is essentially identical to that used in the iPhone 8, but with the processing and smarts of the iPhone 11. The combination is really quite good. In good light its very difficult to tell the difference between photos shot on the iPhone SE and the iPhone 11 Pro  a phone costing more than twice as much. Images are well balanced, with good detail and colour accuracy. In middle-to-low light, noise and grain are more prevalent and images can be fairly dark. The iPhone SE lacks Apples Night Mode, which is a shame, but has the firms portrait mode for people only. Video at up to 4K at 60fps is also very good, particularly at this price point. Overall the rear camera is arguably only beaten by Googles amazing Pixel 3a at anywhere near this price point for still shots, and you have to spend a considerable amount of money to beat either one. The selfie camera is very good too, producing highly detailed and well-exposed shots in reasonable lighting, only getting a bit soft and dark in poor light. Observations    Touch ID works as well as on previous iPhones, but I missed Face ID from the more modern iPhones. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    The haptics on the iPhone SE are simply fantastic Theres no headphone adapter in the box, but there is a set of Lightning EarPods The stereo speakers are surprisingly good You cant expand notifications through a long-press on the lockscreen like you can with every other iPhone, which is annoying (you can on notification pop-ups though) The iPhone SE is too short for some wireless charging stands  Price The iPhone SE is available in black, white or red costing 419 with 64GB of storage, 469 with 128GB and 569 with 256GB. For comparison, the iPhone 11 costs 729, Googles Pixel 3a costs 299, the OnePlus 8 costs 599 and Samsungs Galaxy S20 costs 799. Verdict We dont typically associate Apple with tremendous value, but thats what the iPhone SE is. What was tired in 2017 with the iPhone 8 has been revitalised in 2020 with a dramatic price cut and top-of-the-line processor. The combination is extremely potent. You get an iPhone for a much more palatable 419. The tried and trusted design is dated, but perfectly functional and easy to manage at this size. You get a good screen, OK battery life, a camera thats hard to beat at this price, wireless charging, water resistance and a build quality second to none. But the icing on the cake is the A13 processor and industry-leading software support that should see the iPhone SE receive at least five years of software updates. That means you can buy the iPhone SE and still be safely using it five years later. Not even Googles Pixel 3a will manage that. Its not perfect, of course: the battery life could be longer, the screen could be bigger or the body smaller, theres no headphone socket, no Face ID and it takes ages to charge. Lovers of tiny 4in iPhones such as the previous iPhone SE will be disappointed by the size. But these issues are very easy to overlook at this price. The 2020 iPhone SE is the phone to buy for people who dont care about phones, who just want a phone to work well, not be too big and last a long time. At 419, the cheapest iPhone totally crushes the competition. If you dont want to spend 600-plus, this is the phone to buy. Period.  Pros: lowest-cost new iPhone, five-year-plus software support, A13 Bionic, wireless charging, good camera, top performance, easy to handle, water resistance, Touch ID, amazing value Cons: battery life could be better, no headphone socket, no zoom camera, no Face ID, dated design, very slow charging     The iPhone SE looks particularly good in white or the red variant that also contributes a portion of proceeds to the Global Fund.

"2020-05-01T06:00:16Z","society","Society","Man who starved after benefits cut off 'had pulled out own teeth'","Errol Graham, a 57-year-old grandfather who died of starvation when his benefits were cut off, had become so mentally ill that his family believe he pulled out two of his own teeth with pliers, they have revealed. Fresh details of Grahams decline, and the traumatic impact on his relatives of his lonely death and subsequent inquest, are revealed in a witness statement filed as part of the latest phase of a legal action taken by the family against the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Graham weighed just 28kg when he was found dead at home by bailiffs sent to evict him in June 2018, eight months after all his benefits were stopped because of his failure to attend a fitness for work assessment. His flat had no gas, electricity supply or working phone, just one lightbulb, a broken fridge and no food. Grahams family is seeking a judicial review of the DWPs safeguarding process system, saying he would be alive today if officials had checked properly on his health and wellbeing before automatically revoking his benefits for failing to attend a medical assessment, leaving him without income. Despite knowing Grahams long medical history of mental illness and failing to speak to him, the DWP told his inquest it had followed its safeguarding process correctly and that while it had unfortunate consequences, revoking Grahams benefits was the right decision  for us to have made. The family argues that the secretive benefit safeguarding system has long been unfit for purpose, and failed to protect claimants like Graham slipping through the safety net. They say the government has refused to acknowledge its failures or the scale of the problem, and has ignored calls for a open and accountable overhaul of the system. We now feel like Errols life never mattered to the DWP and that really hurts, the statement by his daughter-in-law Alison Turner says. Errol would want to make a better [social security] system for the millions who rely on it. The latest legal move is likely to amplify calls by campaigners and MPs for an independent inquiry into potentially hundreds of benefit-related deaths in recent years where vulnerable people took their own lives or became fatally ill as they struggled to cope when benefits were withdrawn. Harrowing details of the last days of Grahams life are included in the statement from Turner, who helped the authorities identify Grahams emaciated body shortly after it was discovered and subsequently cleared out his chaotic flat where he had locked himself away for his final days. One of the first discoveries Turner made was a cardboard box lid containing two of his back teeth, and a pair of pliers. I looked at it and I realised Errol must have pulled out his own teeth out. I couldnt imagine how much pain Errol must have been in to resort to ripping his molar teeth out. To me this was an indicator of how severe his mental heath issues were at the time. The extent of his destitution and decline was illustrated by a smashed-up TV in the hallway, Turner says. Two kitchen doors were hanging from their hinges and his blues and reggae CD collection was strewn over the living room floor. There were piles of letters, open and unopened, and his extensive collection of football trophies had disappeared. The contrast with her happy memories of him as a doting grandfather and keen footballer was devastating. Turner could hardly bear to go into his bedroom, where his body had been found on the floor. There was still a strong smell of death in there, it turned your stomach. A moving handwritten letter by Graham to an unnamed DWP benefits examiner attempting to explain his daily mental despair and pleading with him to treat me fairly when his benefits assessment was found. Terror of fit-for-work tests and the risk they carry that benefits will be removed is not uncommon among vulnerable claimants. Graham, who in better times would cycle 20 miles to see his grandchildren every other day, had a long history of serious mental health, including a spell in a psychiatric hospital, a suicide attempt, and depression. Declining health in his last two years led him to isolate from his family. Turners statement says she went to Grahams inquest as his formal witness-under-oath with optimism, believing that it was about fact finding and making changes for the better. She was struck by the aggression of the DWP legal team, which she concluded was only concerned with getting the DWP off the hook. The family says DWP officials broke promises at Grahams inquest last year, saying the department has failed to publish a review of the benefit safeguarding system, or involve the families of victims in improving the way vulnerable claimants are treated. It has never apologised, or invited the family to discuss the matter, Turner says. The familys lawyer, Tessa Gregory, of law firm Leigh Day, said: Our client is being forced to pursue legal action because the DWP has so far refused to make any real changes to the safeguarding policies which allowed their loved one, Errol, to fall through the safety net with such devastating consequences. A National Audit Office report published in February found the DWP had investigated at least 69 suicides linked to benefits problems since 2014 although the true figure is likely to be much higher. There no was evidence the DWP had learned from its reviews or improved its processes, it concluded. A DWP spokeswoman said: Our sympathies are with Mr Grahams family. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

So Im at home. Without belittling whats happening in the world, the lockdown suits the lifestyle of a slightly introspective singer-songwriter. Ive suffered from anxiety for years, which is a form of quarantine. So Ive been doing meditation classes on Facebook. I got into it after the birth of my first child and cant recommend it enough. If you can train your mind to be calmer, you can be happy wherever you are.    Im not a huge consumer of music compared with what I used to be. I had my listening days before I started writing songs and when I write, I tend to fall back on my favourites. But theres been some distinct musical moments. BART by [70s rock band] Ruby is my lockdown classic and I listen to it every day. It was the TV testcard theme on the BBC at the start of the 80s and the countdown music for programmes for schools. I was looking for a different tune, stumbled across it and remembered it instantly. Its very simple, middle of the road American instrumental music, but sometimes that just does it for me.    I cant get my kids to meditate  they just wont  but every night we have a dance-off. Before we go to bed we seem to have the most energy, so weve been dancing to an eclectic bunch of oldies. Theyre very picky about what theyll dance to, but theyve really responded to Malcolm McLarens Double Dutch. A friend of mine  actually Duglas [T Stewart] from the BMX Bandits  reminded me of it. The video is joyful. I love the fact that the song is factually based and gives a shout out to actual New York skipping troupes, such as the Ebonettes. McLaren brought so much to wider attention. He was a real catalyst and had a genuine passion for great stuff.    My wifes a big fan of Hamilton, the musical, and shes always got it on in the car. She told me about John Krasinskis Some Good News YouTube channel and said, Watch this clip and see what happens. Hes got a little girl in the studio who loves Hamilton, and suddenly Lin-Manuel Miranda  the musicals creator  comes on and introduces the whole cast singing the theme tune to this girl. The intimacy of the voices sounds better than the record, and you see the effect on the child. Its magical, a real treat that lifts your spirit.  Mists by Phillip Norman Watson  Id been listening to Erik Satie in our kitchen and must have tweeted something, and a friend got back to me and put me on to Clear Luminous by Phillip Norman Watson. Hes this guy from Portland, Oregon, on a tiny little label. Before the band got together I used to just lose myself in piano doodling, and this is like that. Its beautiful.    Ive also been playing The Boho Dance by Joni Mitchell. I stumbled across The Hissing of Summer Lawns for a pound in a bargain bin in the mid-80s. I was a punker at the time, so had to listen to it in secret, but it became one of my favourite LPs. To my wife it typifies dope-smoking mid-70s Americana, but it just takes me somewhere and I lose myself in the music and lyrics. I love music that lets you escape and occupies your mind completely.    Recently, I asked fans to send me their feelings during the lockdown to turn them into song, which I did. Its a two-parter, called Protecting the Hive and the first  spoken word  part is online now. Its me and Alessandra Lupo [friend, living with Stuarts family during lockdown] reading the fans thoughts over music written by Chris [Geddes, keyboard] from the band. People expressed everything from fear to everyday beauty, such as the joy of hearing birdsong, which Ive been listening to a lot as well. The number of submissions from fans was overwhelming. We could have used hundreds of them.  Protecting the Hive is out now on Belle and Sebastians website.","704"

The week-long project, which was launched by Historic England on Wednesday and runs until Tuesday 5 May, encourages people to share images that reveal how they are dealing with lockdown, self-isolation and social distancing. Ten artists, including Scottee, based in Southend on Sea, and photographers Chloe Dewe Mathews, based in St Leonards-on-Sea, and Coralie Datta, based in Leeds, have also been asked to participate and they will produce special images. 100 of the submitted photographs and images will be inducted into the Historic England Archive.    Picture taken in lockdown by Paul Marks. Photograph: Paul Marks/Historic England   Claudia Kenyatta, the director of regions at Historic England, said the project was a chance to record history and create a unique time capsule for the future during one of the most extraordinary moments in living memory. She said: We want people to show us their experiences of lockdown, how places local to them have transformed, communities have come together, and life has changed for us all. These challenging times are encouraging us all to pause and reflect upon our relationship with our surroundings. We hope this project inspires creativity and reflection, allowing the public create a unique time capsule for the future. The final selection of images will be made up of 50 of the most evocative, informative and inspiring images submitted by the public and 50 works from the contemporary artists, which will be catalogued by the Historic England Archive and be available online. It is the first time the British public has been asked to contribute to the archive, which contains more than 12m photographs taken since 1939, when the social research organisation Mass Observation collected accounts of everyday life during wartime. These diaries are still held in archive storage and Mass Observations work has been praised for touching the parts that other archives cannot reach by drawing an anthropologists gaze on the British people. Founded in 1937, Mass Observation sought to bridge the gap between how the media represented public opinion and what ordinary people actually felt and thought, according to the historian Benjamin Jones. In 2013, the Photographers Gallery in London put on an exhibition of material selected from the Mass Observation archive, which the Guardian critic Sean OHagan said showed the anthropologists to be left-leaning and optimistic, but with a tendency to view the working-class as a kind of exotic species to be studied under an anthropological microscope.","426"
"2020-05-01T06:00:16Z","commentisfree","Opinion","Young people face a jobless future – unless ministers learn from the past","This summer, new cohorts of young people will tumble out of their closed-down schools and colleges into a shut-down world of no work. Some half a million will be leaving university, as many more may be leaving school or ending training and further education to emerge into nothingness. If they have lost their entire summer term, they will have had precious little careers advice, most of which was an early victim of austerity cuts anyway. The wealth of research from previous recessions shows that a long spell of early unemployment risks people being scarred for life.  Before the virus struck, they might have found jobs that didnt match their qualifications in pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes  almost all are now closed. On the dole they will join millions of others, many of them young, along with the 1.4 million people newly thrown on to universal credit. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that young people are already hardest hit, as under-25s were two and half times more likely to have been working in shut-down sectors: just 5% of those in the top decile of earners have lost jobs.   Related: 'Meeting my youth worker is the only time I eat a meal with another person'   Heres a shocking fact hidden by the steep fall in unemployment figures in recent years: there were always at least 800,000 unemployed under-25s adrift  not in education, employment or training (Neets). Many have physical disabilities, illnesses and mental health problems that have been ignored. Many are part of that long tail of lost youth from addicted or violent families; they are care leavers, people with no qualifications pulled into gangs and drugs, and failed by schools and underfunded social services that are unable to pick them up in time. As one employment expert said, These were the ones we didnt fix when the sun shone. Instead of help, they were chased away from claiming benefits by Iain Duncan Smiths exceptionally punitive Jobcentre-sanctioning regimes demanding they sign in every day. This week the alarm was raised by the Youth Employment Group, a new consortium including the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), the Princes Trust and others determined to prevent another lost generation of long-term unemployed people. Tony Wilson, director of the IES, and a former senior DWP researcher, has been watching the weekly vanishing of vacancies in horror: They are the lowest ever, three times worse than ever before and each week it gets worse. All sorts of jobs have gone, he says  in accountancy, finance and IT, along with the rest. In a recession, what kills is not people losing jobs, but the lack of anyone hiring, says Wilson. It will take a phenomenal government effort to fire up good work programmes. Already Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has talked this week of winding down the governments furlough scheme. But what happens next to all the millions of employees who will be cast off? Young people are always at the back of the queue. Ministers have no memory: they deliberately forget anything some other government did. They prefer to reinvent wheels, marking their own thumbprint on schemes, regardless of voluminous evidence on what works. But this time, if they want to prevent unemployment armageddon, they should look back to what Labour did, both with 1997s new deal for young people and its post-2008 crash rescue programmes. What worked was job guarantees and high-quality training, experienced advisers and subsidies to employers to hire those who were unemployed. One of the most successful was the post-crash Future Jobs Fund, a generous-spirited and popular plan. I followed its progress in detail, interviewing its beneficiaries and employers who took people on. After six months intensive help to find work with a personal adviser, people were offered expensive training in almost anything. If still out of work after nine months, any employer taking them on was given a subsidy of 6,500. There were strict conditions, drawn up with the CBI and TUC: no job substitution, no displacing other workers, but the creation of an extra job doing something of benefit to the community. All these Labour-era work programmes were intensively researched.   Related: Coronavirus is teaching the UK it's wrong to deride the practical professions | Liz Lightfoot   The Future Jobs Fund ran for little more than a year before the Tories turned it into a 2010 election weapon. David Cameron abolished it with a flourish; he said it was expensive, badly targeted and did not work, an example of Labour over-spending. Not so. Instead his action was an example of his governments taste for policy-based evidence-making  pick your political policy first and invent the evidence later. Cameron didnt bother to wait for actual results. The academic evidence supporting the programme  which involved following up all cases and control groups, tracing what became of recipients  emerged a year too late. But it showed this had been an unprecedented success that produced a net gain to the UK: compared with control groups it had raised the number of unemployed who went into permanent work by a quarter  a phenomenal success, says Wilson.  It saved 7,750 for each participant in extra tax receipts and reduced benefit bills. There is plentiful research on other schemes, too: the successful German Kurzarbeit (short-time work) scheme offers a way to turn furloughing into a part-time work subsidy. Look back, too, at Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal for how governments can invest to employ: there was no lack of urgent public works after a decade of neglect. But above all learn from the best of Labours programmes. Rebrand them as Boris bonuses or whatever, deny their Labour origins, but use the high-grade evidence for what works to help save another generation from the lifelong damage of extensive unemployment.

Good morning  Warren Murray with a round-up of the main headline news this Friday morning.
Tensions have emerged in NHS England as it deals with how to redeploy BAME staff away from the virus frontline to safeguard their health. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is more than 2.5 times that of the white population, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. It also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. One health official said it was really tricky  you have to make quite difficult decisions about certain people being on the frontline [dealing with Covid patients] and not others. Its not like trusts are awash with staff they can start redeploying [to cover BAME colleagues], especially as they have already had to redeploy people to staff Covid wards.
Donald Trump is accused of putting US intelligence agencies under pressure to suggest the virus came from a state-run laboratory in China. The president was asked a few hours ago whether he had seen anything that gives you a high degree of confidence to that effect, and replied: Yes, I have. But the office of the director of national intelligence (DNI) had only just gotten through saying that the intelligence community does not believe coronavirus was manmade or genetically modified, though it would examine any emerging information and intelligence about whether it came from animals or a laboratory accident. A whistleblower complaint by a US scientist who was abruptly removed from heading the search for a vaccine may add to evidence that Donald Trump is leaning on government agencies to back his claims about the merits of unproven treatments. Dr Rick Bright says he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) because he resisted an effort to expand the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19.
Boris Johnson has promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces might safely reopen once lockdown restrictions are eased. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the UK death toll, taking it to a total of 26,771, the prime minister suggested the worst was over. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope, he said, three days after returning to work as he recovers from Covid-19 himself.

Father of Afrobeat dies  The Nigerian drummer Tony Allen, credited for creating Afrobeat along with Fela Kuti, died suddenly at the age of 79 in Paris on Thursday, said his manager, who added it was not linked to coronavirus. Allen was the drummer and musical director of Fela Kutis band Africa 70 in the 1960s and 70s. They created Afrobeat, fusing west African musical styles with US jazz and funk, and recording some 40 albums together over the course of 26 years.

In todays long read: cholera has largely been beaten in the west, but it still kills tens of thousands of people in poorer countries every year. As we search for a cure for coronavirus, we have to make sure it will be available to everyone, not just to those in wealthy nations, writes Neil Singh.
There are fears that the rush to supply wealthier countries with coronavirus tests may destabilise the fight against other illnesses that kill millions in poorer countries. Makers can get about 18 cents for a rapid malaria test but $10 for a Covid-19 test, says Dr Catharina Boehme, an adviser to the WHO. They are shifting their production to Covid-19 tests, Boehme said. Peter Sands, from the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said: This is not the time to be to doing anything that weakens our ability to diagnose and treat those infected with HIV, TB and malaria in a timely and cost-effective way. Doing so would cost lives.

A spokesman for the bank, which is owned by a group of industry super funds, said it made the move after figuring out that the redraw facility of some legacy home loans could lead to some customers falling behind their original repayment schedules. Home loan redraw facilities allow borrowers to make extra mortgage payments and either use the money to pay off their loan quicker or draw down cash later on. Customers who have flooded the banks Facebook page with complaints appeared to have been caught by surprise by the move.   Related: Australian ministers love to bash the banks. They should bypass them instead | Richard Denniss   The money we lost is actually my husbands redundancy payment as he was retrenched last week, one customer, said in a post to the page last week. The customer said her redraw limit had been slashed by over $16,000. We are not eligible for Centrelink payments and were relying on those funds to get us through, she said. Another said his limit had been slashed by $20,000 with no notice. Actually no communication at all, he said. Lucky I am not relying on that amount for future purchases, but how would you know that? I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years, and am well ahead of required payments. Some customers said they had taken their grievances to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. An AFCA spokesman said the authority could not comment on specific cases. ME Bank did not respond to questions about when it discovered the problem, when it made the change or what the typical reduction in redraw was. Its spokesman said about 4% of home loan customers were affected by the change. This equates to a little over 20,000 loans, based on home loan numbers disclosed in the banks most recent annual report. ME is in the process of contacting affected customers, the spokesman said.   Related: Banks make it difficult and expensive to find cheap home loan rates, consumer watchdog finds   Some customers could be at risk of not meeting their repayment commitments, potentially leaving them open to financial hardship at the end of the loan term.

For customers whose limits have been reduced, the bank will look to rearrange financing at the banks cost.

"2020-05-01T05:05:09Z","commentisfree","Opinion","We need to reduce our dependence on China, and have the courage to call it out when required","The last time Australia had a coherent and effective policy on China was when John Howard was prime minister. Howard emphasised the positives in what was then a much simpler trading relationship. Then, in Deng Xiaopings famous words, China was hiding its capabilities and biding its time. The Peoples Liberation Army was nowhere near the military powerhouse it is today. The Communist partys forced annexation of much of the South China Sea was two decades in the future. There is no going back to the Howard era. What has changed is that Xi Jinping has cemented his countrys path toward becoming a more aggressive, highly nationalistic, military power. Xi is doing his utmost to recentralise all power in the hands of the Communist party. Leninist authoritarianism enabled by artificial intelligence and 5G connectivity is a chilling prospect and one that cannot tolerate internal dissent or external expressions of disapproval about the Partys performance.   Related: In a testy post-Covid-19 world, Chinese sanctions of Australian goods may be closer than ever | Richard McGregor   All of this was in train before Covid-19, and the locomotive is of the bullet variety. The speed of Chinas military growth, its global cyber and intelligence infiltration, its use of financial power to buy legitimate and illegitimate influence in countries all around the world  all these factors are irrevocably changing how we must deal with Beijing. Looking ahead, the biggest challenge for Australian governments is how to manage the huge risk of being overly dependent on a state whose strategic trajectory fundamentally compromises our deepest national security interests. China quite explicitly wants to supplant the US as the prime manager of security in the Indo-Pacific. That undercuts our alliance relationship and defence planning. The Communist party, moreover, demands a style of supine fealty to their political dominance that cannot be squared with Australian democracy and values. Hence ambassador Cheng Jingyes wolf warrior intrusion in Australian politics this week after Scott Morrisons call for an international investigation into the origins of the virus. Party central has directed diplomatic missions to more actively and angrily intervene in domestic debates, denying that Covid-19 has anything to do with wet markets, Wuhan, or indeed the party. The ambassadors concern  that the Chinese people, whose feelings have been hurt by Australia, will unbidden and spontaneously stop buying our wine and beef and stop studying and visiting here  is a line regularly deployed by Chinese officials and Party controlled media if countries offend Beijings sensibilities. This list of offences is growing and includes any form of contact with Taiwan or Tibets Dalai Lama; opposition to Chinas illegal annexation of features in the South China Sea; Australias decision excluding Chinese companies from the 5G network; failure to support the Belt and Road initiative; mentioning the Tiananmen Square massacre; complaining about Chinese cyber espionage; mentioning human rights and Xinjiang; the anti-interference laws and clampdowns on foreign payments to Australian political parties. How can Australia shape a relationship with this increasingly sharp-elbowed state? For some years our politicians and officials tried to do and say nothing that would draw Beijings attention. One very senior Canberra official recently put to me the proposition that a week where the Government didnt have to talk about China was a week in which we could sell it more coal and iron ore. Covid-19 has ended the dont mention the war strategy. One senses at political levels a deepening anger at constantly being challenged to pay homage to Beijings party line. I suggest five approaches that might produce better relations with the PRC. First, our politicians, officials and media should spend less time obsessing about criticism from Beijing. When embassies make sharp comments, they are performing for their head office. We can afford to let much of this go through to the keeper.   Related: Using the virus to bash Beijing could trigger a new cold war   Second, we need to be clear in stating our own core interests just as China does. One core interest is that China shouldnt attempt to establish a military base in the Pacific. We need to be strong with Pacific Island states on that point as well as with Beijing. Third, when China clearly transgresses, we should publicly call out the bad behaviour. For example, you can take it to the bank that China is right now engaged in full-on cyber spying on government agencies, politicians and businesses in Australia. We should be saying so publicly. This goes to the issue of developing trusted relations between capitals. Fourth, Scott Morrison should use his new national cabinet to brief state and territory leaders about what our national security and intelligence professionals understand about Chinese influencing and espionage activity. That will quickly put an end to state flirtations with Belt and Road memorandums and happy-happy sister city relationships. Lastly, with coal and iron ore we can be confident that we have products that China wants. They would find it painful to switch long-term suppliers. Chinese consumers also like Australias clean green produce, notwithstanding party flimflam about hurt feelings. All the same we should be working as hard as we can to reduce economic dependence and diversify, diversify, diversify. Business should stop whining about how hard that is and understand that protecting the national interest is key to their own long term survival.

Eleanor Sharpston QC, advocate general to the court in Luxembourg, has lodged two claims challenging her replacement by a Greek lawyer before her term in office was scheduled to end next year. Her departure will not necessarily end direct British involvement with the ECJ. A claim has been submitted by a team of London-based lawyers arguing that even though the UK as a nation is leaving the EU, its citizens cannot be deprived of EU citizenship without their consent. Sharpston, whose mandate was due to end in October 2021, has submitted two claims  against the council of the European Union, which represents the remaining 27 EU states, and against the ECJ itself. At the start of the year, Brussels issued a statement saying the mandates of all UK-related members of EU institutions would automatically end on 31 January. Sharpston was the exception to the rule and was told that she would stay on until a successor could take over. A Greek replacement for her has now been found. The number of advocates general, who advise the courts judges, is fixed at 11. A fellow of Kings College, Cambridge and a former joint head of chambers in London, Sharpston has been at the ECJ since 2006. Earlier this year, contemplating the possibility of legal action, she told the Law Gazette: It may be that the very last service I can render to my court is to see whether there is something I can do to push back against the member states intruding into the courts autonomy and independence. She is understood to be arguing that she should be be allowed to stay in office until her current six-year term expires and that her removal undermines the judicial independence of the court. Court rules, it is said, ensure that judges and advocate generals can only be removed when they reach the end of their mandate or reach the obligatory retirement age. The ECJ told the Guardian it could not confirm the identity of claimants in the two cases submitted. The courts last British judge, Christopher Vajda, lost his seat in February despite the UK remaining within the single market and customs union until the end of 2020. There are 27 judges sitting on the ECJ  one for every member state. A separate action legal action has been lodged at the ECJ this month by lawyers acting for Prof Joshua Silver, a physicist at Oxford University. The claim is being led by Prof Takis Tridimas of Matrix Chambers and lawyers from the London firm DAC Beachcroft. They argue that while the withdrawal agreement between the UK government and the EU has resulted in the UK as a nation leaving the EU, the fundamental status and rights of the British citizens of the European Union cannot be removed without their consent. Stephen Hocking, a partner at DAC Beachcroft, said: In the withdrawal agreement, the EU council purported to remove fundamental individual rights from a group of citizens of the European Union, namely UK nationals, without any due process and without any reference to them. In doing so it acted unlawfully. EU citizenship is a citizenship like any other, and it confers individual rights on citizens that cannot be taken away by an agreement between governments. If he is successful, UK citizens would retain their rights as EU citizens, for example the right to live and work in EU member states. This week Guy Verhofstadt, the former Brexit coordinator for the European parliament, tweeted in support of the legal action: People received European citizenship with the treaty of Maastricht. Will be interesting to see, if a government decides to leave, its citizens automatically lose their European citizenship. They shouldnt do!  The case, for which more than 67,000 has already been raised, is being supported by crowdfunding through the website Crowdfunder.","669"

We doctors arent used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing  all of which are changing every day. But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them  not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years time.   Related: Cholera and coronavirus: why we must not repeat the same mistakes  podcast   For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world. * * * To reach my grandparents house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the regions regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the areas lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits  mangoes, lychees and guava  that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents. The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old inscription at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the clinical picture of patients afflicted by severe cholera: The lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire. In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices. Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they dont receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours. For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for choleras spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which originated in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it. Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half. In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.    A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001. Photograph: SCHALK/EPA   In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called Isabella Hazard. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly. It is hard to imagine the panic created by the Blue Death, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory  that the disease was associated with bad airs (or miasmas)  inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets to destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys. So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing millions of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary Mario Adorno accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting a devilish plot bent on poisoning the people of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them. But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive  they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy. * * * In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks. When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by miasmas. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a dot map of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same water pump on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.    A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854. Photograph: Alicia Canter/Observer   This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snows revelations led to the creation of Improvement Trusts and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but only 1% of Indians outside the colonial walls. Today, more than half of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isnt their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people. * * * John Snows discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick. In Florence, a contemporary of Snows spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool. Pacini studied the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue. Pacini recognised that these dots  which he called vibrios (commas), because of their shape  must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades. Pacini had discovered the germ, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, Hemanda Nath Chatterjee developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today. Six years later, Sambhu Nath De discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed  like whole spices  even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease. These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.

Photograph: Philimon Bulawayo/REUTERS   Today, its easy for westerners to get their hands on the most effective vaccine, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. Its no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will protect you for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they dont have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the average Indian farmer would have to work for three whole days. There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. Thats hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India. There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes  the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera. So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK. Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced choleras reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath Des seminal research, a new pandemic  the seventh  sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth. * * * In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution. This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first International Sanitary Conference, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892. According to Anne-Emanuelle Birn, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the WHO. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated  not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, cholera claimed more lives than the coronavirus. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west. * * * A map of the places still struggling with cholera shows 47 countries  in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer have shown, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates  despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart. The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on another nearby island, Ebeye. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to nine people, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets. At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.    The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Photograph: Thomas Reiss/USGS   On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case. What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people. It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera. * * * There are fears that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the four endemic coronaviruses; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the worlds poorest regions. The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world. There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries buying up so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the outsourcing of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the worlds gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the digital infrastructure necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.    An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017. Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images   It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called 10/90 gap, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the worlds population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right. Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, has compared the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls Global Health 4.0: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trumps removal of funding, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick. Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyones interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam has written that enormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability. To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a communitarian globalism: a bottom-up approach, based on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the communist government in Kerala giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the Somalian doctors offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to Cuba allowing an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors. There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera. For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come. For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.

"2020-05-01T05:00:15Z","film","Film","Gael García Bernal: 'The pandemic has taught me that I need something to say'","At the start of the century, the director Alfonso Cuarn was casting Y Tu Mam Tambin, the bawdy but plangent road movie he had written with his brother Carlos about two oversexed Mexican teenagers, the wealthy Tenoch and his poorer, grungier friend Julio. Alfonso called me very excitedly, recalls Carlos Cuarn. He said: I know whos going to play Julio! Ive seen him in Alejandros movie. Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, that is, whose ferocious dog-fighting drama Amores Perros was about to be released. I said: No, no, Ive found Julio; I saw the perfect actor in this short film, De Tripas, Corazn. Hes incredible: his eyes, the way he manages silence ... Eventually, the brothers realised they were talking about the same person: Gael Garca Bernal, who was then just 21. The son of theatre actors, he had become a star in his early teens on the Mexican soap opera El Abuelo y Yo (Grandpa and I) before decamping to London to study at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Irritu plucked him out mid-term for Amores Perros and he stole that movie as the twitchy-hipped tearaway who was every bit as feral as his champion rottweiler. His mutable features could switch from cherubic to lupine to gravely smouldering; his nerve endings felt exposed like frayed electrical wires. You can feel all his emotions, all his vulnerability, says Cuarn. He fills the screen completely. After my wife met him, she said: Wow, hes so handsome, but I thought he would be tall. Hes like Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman, the kind of actor whose aura and energy makes you think theyre huge.    In that wham-bam first half-decade of Bernals film career, he gave four killer performances, any one of which would have been enough to build a reputation on: Amores Perros, Y Tu Mam Tambin, Pedro Almodvars Bad Education, part of which he spent looking ravishing in drag, and The Motorcycle Diaries, in which he played a young Che Guevara. Now 41, Bernal has alternated between mainstream projects in the US  such as his five-year stint as an eccentric conductor in the delightful Amazon series Mozart in the Jungle, or his touching voice work as a balladeer trapped in the afterlife in the Disney/ Pixar gem Coco  and politically charged work in Latin America. When he calls me today, it is from Mexico City, one of two locations that is home to him (the other is Buenos Aires) and where he happened to be when the lockdown began. Whats beautiful right now in Mexico, he says brightly, is that straight after the daily 7pm press conference, there are films on TV from the golden age of Mexican cinema, from the 1930s to the 1950s. Its been wonderful to watch them in this light. I see the hopes of the actors and film-makers from 70 or 80 years ago. I see their fears, their experiments, what they were trying to build and express. I find it all incredibly moving as a document of humanity. He thinks the current crisis is altering for ever the way we look at art. Theres something more straightforward now in how we see things  its stronger, more elemental and pulsating. Were so emotionally charged. Artistic expression can affect us for the better, making us feel were all in this questioning together. It is, he suggests, an ideal state in which to approach Ema, his third film with the Chilean director Pablo Larran, following No, about the 1988 plebiscite on Pinochet, and the fantasy-biopic Neruda, in which he played a police inspector who doubts his own existence. Ema is the pairs most challenging collaboration, populated largely by destructive and dislikable characters; only gradually do their prickly exteriors peel away to reveal the wounded souls within. Bernal has the small but pivotal role of Gastn, a choreographer married to the dancer Ema (Mariana Di Girolamo). He is plainly callous  he taunts her over their recent failed adoption of a seven-year-old boy  but Bernal shows that Gastn is suffering, too.    As a young Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries. Photograph: Paula Prandini/Imagenet   There is something about the nature of his job that makes him feel very lonely. That was interesting to explore: hes the centre of gravity at this dance company, he puts everything together, and that leads to a lot of loneliness. Its like directing a film, which is a solitary pursuit even though its collective. Bernal himself has directed two features  the 2007 drama Dficit and the as-yet-unreleased Chicuarotes, about young Mexican hoodlums  as well as founding, with his childhood friend and Y Tu Mam Tambin co-star Diego Luna, two production companies and a documentary film festival, Ambulante. So could Gastn be a portrait of himself or Larran? No, not at all! he laughs. But Pablo and I both understand him in his isolation and his stupefaction. Perhaps, then, he is comparable to Rodrigo, the conductor from Mozart in the Jungle, who is also a restless, demanding creative type? Yes! Except that Rodrigo represents happiness and adventure, whereas Gastn is the opposite. Rodrigo is Maradona. Gastn is more like Mike Tyson. His role in Ema is notable for keeping his usual electrifying charm in check; if Gastn is sexual, it is only in the most remote, reptilian way. Such unpalatable parts are rare on Bernals CV. In Fernando Meirelless Blindness, he played an unscrupulous bartender taking advantage of an epidemic that renders its sufferers sightless; in one scene, he performed a head-waggling, bad-taste version of I Just Called to Say I Love You. And in The King, his English-language debut from 2005, he was a psychopath calmly wreaking revenge on his long-lost father. Gael had balls, to be blunt, says James Marsh, that pictures British director. We went to quite a few up-and-coming young American actors, some of whom have big careers now, and none of them would go near that script. But Gael liked the idea of playing someone with this cold surface. I love way he moves in the film: hes always slinking around, more animal than human. The character has pure evil in him, but he played it in this blank way so that you didnt hate him.   Theres this incredible ease about Gael. I think he works far harder than one would imagine  Saffron Burrows    Nor, by the end of Larrans picture, do we hate Gastn. Whether we understand him is another matter, one that Bernal thinks may not be so important. Thats always the dilemma, right? Understanding. What the hell does it mean? There is that saying. I think it was Picasso, no? Someone said they didnt understand his work. So he asked them: You like eating eggs in the morning? You like your huevos rotos? Yeah, I like them. OK. But do you understand them? He chuckles at that. It is better, he says, for the audience to know that they dont know the characters motivations. Thats the journey you embark on when youre building a character. Little by little, the pieces come together. OK, how would this character feel in the rain? What would he do outside? And you start to discover them. Playing Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, there came a point where I could improvise a whole day of his life. I had that ownership of what he would do in any situation. Thats the nirvana of acting: being able to go into places where youre not sure what the hell is going to happen. Saffron Burrows, one of Bernals co-stars on Mozart in the Jungle, witnessed his process up close. Theres this incredible ease about Gael, she tells me. One thing that was so enjoyable was his improvising, the little riffs he developed, the surprises. Every take was very different. I think he works far harder than one would imagine. Sometimes wed be doing the same scene for nine hours and Id see him mulling, working stuff out, honing it. She and Bernal go way back: they starred together as honeymooners in David Nichollss short play Aftersun, staged at the Old Vic in 2005.    Bernal with Saffron Burrows in 2005. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian   Burrows even recalls frequenting the bar where he worked while he was a drama student in the late 90s. I used to go bobbing about with friends at this Cuban place in Islington where he was the barman. Hes had that London training and hes always carried this internationalism about him. Hes very welcoming. When we were making Mozart, he was always at the helm, always being the host. Although necessarily remote as Gastn, he does get to reveal the characters churning inner turmoil during a frantic speech railing against his wifes lifestyle. There are some opinions he has which I share, Bernal says. When he mocks the idea of going to Los Angeles and taking selfies, for instance. I would say there is no bigger treason for humankind. Its throwing your life away. I know it sounds horrible. But going to Los Angeles and taking selfies serves absolutely no transcendent purpose! Bernal resisted that citys siren call even before he and his former partner, the Argentine actor Dolores Fonzi, had two children: a son, Lzaro, now 11, and a daughter, Libertad, who is nine. He stayed put. Not because I didnt want to take selfies! There are just so many stories I wanted to tell. I wanted to change things with my own hands, not follow someone elses route. Marsh thinks that Bernals integrity is vital to his acting. I have enormous respect for him and how he refused to take the easy path. He could easily have gone to Hollywood and become Antonio Banderas, but he didnt. Hes stretched himself and matured into a great artist. Cuarn, who went on to direct Bernal and Luna in the football saga Rudo y Cursi, agrees. Gael and Diego are the most respected actors of their generation in Mexico. Hes involved with social issues like immigration, and hes very outspoken politically. He is both criticised and celebrated, depending on who is in government here. And though he has lived everywhere, he has never left Mexico or stopped being involved in Mexican issues. Even noble, conscientious actors are only human. Has he ever taken any roles purely for the money? Oh, there have been one or two, the actor says ruefully. I invite him to name and shame them, but he declines with a giggle: Noooo! So lets just say it is oddly comforting that even a performer as good as he is can still make films as poor as Letters to Juliet, where he played Amanda Seyfrieds insufferable boyfriend, or A Little Bit of Heaven, in which he was an oncologist who falls for Kate Hudson as she dies photogenically and at great length. I did certain projects I wasnt too sure of, he admits. Sometimes there would be a pleasant surprise, sometimes a very bad one where Id think: Its not worth it, man. What am I doing? If this pandemic has made me learn one thing, it is that I have to work less. I need to nurture and have something to say. So hes not going to do another film he doesnt believe in? I think so, yeah. Its a commonplace thing to say. But now, thanks to this situation, its even more acute, right? Im just going to do what I like. Im going to be stricter about that from now on.

One of his daughters, Hannah Ingram-Moore, thought it might make a nice little story for the local media, and so on 7 April her consultancy firm, Maytrix, knocked up a press release heralding his mission.
The release included a photograph of the then 99-year-old wearing a navy blue fleece, pushing a walking frame on which was balanced a panama hat and his stick. We are all being rightly advised to stay home, stay safe and protect our NHS, and that is exactly what local 99-year-old Tom Moore is doing, the copy began  and, with it, one of the most startlingly successful fundraising stories of our time.

How exactly a centenarian managed to capture a nations heart  prompting an RAF fly-by, an upgrade in military rank and Piers Morgan pledging ten grand of his own money, not to mention an array of conspiracy theories  is a tale that proves both the ongoing power of the mainstream media and the British publics hunger for joy during a time of bleak national crisis.
The global media onslaught began in Milton Keynes, where the press release caught the eye of Damien Lucas, head of news for a group of local newspapers. Within a few hours the story was on Bedford Today, with a headline about the ambitions of a Bedford man and his 100th birthday challenge, inspired by the treatment he received from the NHS after breaking his hip and for skin cancer.

A local ITV report followed and by 10 April, Good Friday, Captain Tom was live on BBC Breakfast. You have lived, and you have seen some tough times in this country, can you inspire people who are watching now, just reassure them, it will be fine? asked Naga Munchetty. Remember, he said, tomorrow is a good day, tomorrow you will maybe find everything will be much better than today.
A star was born. The BBC Breakfast team watched, staggered, as donations to Captain Toms Just Giving Page went from 1,000 to a million and beyond. Before long, their rivals on Good Morning Britain had picked up the story, with Piers Morgan pledging 10,000 of his own money.
Back in Marston Moretaine, a small village 12 miles from Milton Keynes, journalists and well-wishers began congregating outside the house Captain Tom shares with Hannah and her family, hoping to catch a glimpse of their hero doing his laps.
On 16 April Moore finished his challenge live on BBC Breakfast surrounded by a guard of honour from the 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. By 20 April he had raised over 20m and had recorded a duet with Michael Ball that was on its way to number one in the charts.
The family began to worry about crowds outside the house. A neighbour got a number for DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles to see if he could help. Hannah, a huge DIY SOS fan, texted asking if this was really Nick Knowles. He suggested a Facetime call to prove his identity and soon had arranged for a fence to be put up outside the family garden, according to Megan Carver, Knowless longtime PR.
Carver came on board last week to help field inquiries for free. One of her first calls was to Schillings, the notorious London libel firm, famed for its sky-high fees and celebrity clientele. It was probably the easiest phone call Ive ever made, said Carver. I explained that Captain Toms family needed a bit of help and Schillings immediately said, yes, and of course this will be pro bono.
Schillings contacted Ipso, the press regulator, to ask journalists to stop either leaning over the fence or placing their long-focus-lens cameras through hedges to take intrusive photographs, noting that the family had set up a Twitter account, @captaintommoore containing images that could be used for free.







Then came the backlash. The family had to refute claims that they or Maytrix were profiting from the fundraising. A virulent Whatsapp message had spread, claiming they were lining their own pockets and accusing JustGiving, the fundraising platform, of keeping up to 2m. Full Fact, the independent fact-checking charity, reported JustGiving was in fact taking around 1% of the total: around 320,000 of the 32m pledged by Thursday late afternoon for NHS Charities Together.
Back at the village, the family could no longer cope with the deluge of cards and presents arriving from around the world. Bill Chandi, the local postmaster, stepped in to help, offering his post office as their correspondence address. Since then I have been working 24/7 and it is my honour to do so, said Chandi.

Bedford school, where Captain Toms grandson Benji is a pupil, offered its school hall to house the cards. By Thursday they were spilling out into the classrooms too. Hes already received at least 160,000 cards, said Chandi. Quite a few people want to make sure they definitely get to the right place so they send them recorded delivery, which means we have to log them all in the post office  we dont sign for them because of social distancing. The local sorting office has had to set up a separate Captain Tom team with two or three dedicated workers, he added.
On Thursday, Captain Tom became Colonel Tom, promoted to an honorary role by the British Army. Boris Johnson wished him happy birthday, the Queen sent her customary telegram and a wartime Spitfire and Hurricane flew over Marston Moretaine.

He has been the perfect hero for our times, says BBC Breakfast editor Richard Frediani. Theres nothing self-centred or grandiose about Captain Tom. Hes just a wonderful man. You can tell it has hit a nerve with viewers when they are looking for something to rally around. He brings a little bit of good news and light into what are very difficult times.","1005"
"2020-05-01T05:00:15Z","tv-and-radio","Television & radio","Hollywood review – Ryan Murphy’s Netflix epic is a hollow ode to showbiz","I suppose you could argue that it is entirely proper for a show called Hollywood, about the lure of the impossibly glamorous dream factory in the 1940s, to promise so much in its opening episodes and ultimately deliver so little. But this is a Ryan Murphy show  the second to emerge from his five-year, $300m, free-rein deal with Netflix  and hopes were high that the golden boy of television could turn his attention to the golden gge of film and create a 24-carat wonder. He has, after all, done just that with far less promising material. The People v OJ Simpson, part of the American Crime Story anthology series, took the infamous murder trial and turned it into a hybrid of soap, biopic and compelling commentary on race relations in the US, access to justice, media distortions and public complicity. The Assassination of Gianni Versace did virtually the same, but in the fashion world. Hollywood dresses the stage enticingly. We are quickly introduced to all our major players. Theres David Corenswet (River Barkley in Murphys first Netflix creation, The Politician) as aspiring actor Jack Castello. He works at a petrol station run, as one was in real life by Scotty Bowers, as a front for sex work. Jack recruits Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope), a gay, black aspiring writer to help out with the guy stuff hes not keen on, and Archie soon finds himself developing a relationship with one of his tricks  Roy Fitzgerald. Roy gets an agent, who demands sexual favours as well as 10%, has his name changed to Rock Hudson and finds himself on the path to stardom at a price he can barely begin to reckon. Patti LuPone, as former silent movie star Avis Amberg, is one of Jacks keenest customers and the wife of a studio head. Jack is soon under contract. Meanwhile, wannabe director Stanley Ainsworth (Darren Criss, another member of the Murphy rep company, last seen knocking it out of the park as Versaces murderer Andrew Cunanan) is trying to get a film made starring Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong (Michelle Krusiec)  who has always presented a problem for the industry because of her race and is now having the temerity to age, too  in tribute to his own half-Asian heritage, but he needs a hit first. He picks up Archies script about Peg Entwistle, an actor who killed herself, and plans to cast his black girlfriend  currently suffering the standard humiliations of a starlet in Hollywood  as the lead.    We head into a counterfactual history, and the show falls apart. This should be the perfect set-up for a scabrous look at prejudice, corruption, the trading of sexual currency, coercion, the well-oiled machinations that underlie an industry and how it all shapes history  all through a #MeToo lens. But it becomes a mere wish-fulfilment fantasy that, whether it intends to or not, suggests that if a few people had just been that bit braver, then movies  and therefore the world!  would be a glorious, egalitarian Eden. It is a show that is smug and obtuse enough to believe la la lands self-regarding idea that celluloid art directly shapes our lives. Maybe this is what happens when youre given $300m and a free rein. Maybe self-congratulation cannot help but seep in. But its a crushing disappointment nevertheless. Not ready for its closeup, Mr DeMille.","560"

As I turn over a partially buried tunnel of bark, woodlice scatter, a cluster of garden and brown-lipped snails shrink back into their banded shells, and a common cryptops centipede scuttles for cover. A lone earwig darts out of a depression in the soil. In the late afternoon sunlight, its mahogany-coloured exoskeleton has the glowing patina of antique leather. It pauses for a second, beaded antennae twitching, then turns and dashes back to the shallow hole. An earwigs sex can be determined by looking at the shape of its cerci, the forked appendages at the rear of its abdomen. In males, these pincers are sharply curved and reminiscent of a male stag beetles mandibles  broader at the base, with crenelate teeth on the lower part of the inner margin. This individuals pincers are less robust, straight and held almost parallel, identifying her as female. My shadow falls across her, but she stands her ground. As I peer closer, the reason for her reluctance to retreat is immediately obvious  she is standing guard over a clutch of around 40 off-white oval eggs.    Their mother will continue to protect them from predators until after the second instar. Photograph: FLPA/Alamy   Its likely that the nymphs will begin to hatch any day now, emerging as tiny, translucent replicas of their parents. In their transition from egg to adult, the larvae will go through four instars  developmental stages between moults. Exhibiting a level of maternal care unusual among insects, their mother will continue to protect them from predators and feed them until after the second instar, when they will start venturing out of the nest at night to forage by themselves. Despite the females dedicated parenting, it is unlikely that the whole clutch will survive. Early hatchers often engage in siblicide, killing and cannibalising their unborn nest mates  behaviour that not only reduces competition, but also provides direct nutritional benefit. Carefully covering the brood chamber, I leave the earwig to her vigil. Come July, Ill venture out on warm evenings to search for her progeny feeding on the flowers and foliage of my dahlias and clematis.","373"

It is certain to preselect the mayor of Bega Valley Shire, Kristy McBain, as candidate although nominations dont close until noon on Monday. This election should be about the seat of Eden-Monaro, it shouldnt be about anything else, apart from Eden-Monaro, McBain told reporters in Canberra on Friday. The prospect is for a campaign with big-name Liberal and National candidates against a local with no national profile. And it could also mean the prime minister, Scott Morrison, would have a limited role because Labor is certain to encourage hostility towards him over his delayed response to bushfires in the area.   Related: Scott Morrison sets his sights on 'once-in-a-century' byelection win in Eden-Monaro   The government is hoping the substantial political capital Morrison has gained through approval of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic will help a Liberal or National candidate create history. The New South Wales Nationals leader and deputy premier, John Barilaro, who lives in the electorate, said on Friday he would go to his farm to consider his byelection options over the weekend. McBain clearly has the Labor party power brokers behind her. The highly unlikely event of her not being endorsed by the ALP national executive on Monday would be a challenge to the leadership of Anthony Albanese, who on Friday made clear he was her champion. And it would be a waste of a website Labor officials set up in her name on Thursday in anticipation of her being chosen on Monday. McBain, a mother of three, on Friday outlined her claim to be the grassroots candidate against possible Liberal and National contenders for the seat narrowly retained last election by retiring Labor MP Mike Kelly. I am from the community. And I have worked for the community for a number of years now, McBain told reporters in Canberra. Over the last six months its become abundantly clear to me, and I am more resolute now than ever, that leadership needs to happen, and it needs to happen at a local level. Calling for a political re-set, McBain said her community had been left behind. She pointed to unrest in the electorate over federal government assistance after three bushfires in two years, drought, and now the Covid-19 crisis. And with these three disasters happening concurrently, we do not and are not receiving the support that we need, she said. McBain said: We have people that are still living in tents and caravans on properties. People that havent been able to receive any meaningful support from the government. People that are being left behind in this Covid crisis as well, you know. In our electorate alone, we have a huge number of seasonal and casual workers, and none of those have been picked up in any of the packages provided by the government, either in the bushfire crisis or in the Covid crisis. Labor has smoothed the way for a preselection but one of the first things to be done was to make her a member of the party. I was a member of Young Labor at university and early in my career, McBain said. My membership lapsed because at that time I was building a career, and as many people understand, in your early 20s you dont have a lot of spare cash. So, Ive re-joined the Labor party. My values have always been aligned with that of the Labor party, and that is that no person should be left behind.","583"

Set in the year 2120, the series called El-Nehaya, meaning The End, imagines a bleak future with cloned robots, battered skyscrapers, and relentless violence. In episode one, the protagonist, played by acclaimed actor Youssef el-Sherif, tells his students of a war to liberate Jerusalem that occurred before Israel turned 100, less than three decades from the present day. He said Israeli Jews of European origin returned to Europe. However, he did not mention what happened to the several million Jews in Israel of Middle Eastern descent. The US, too, had broken up, said el-Sherif, who plays a teacher and engineer. Israels foreign ministry said the show was unfortunate and unacceptable. Especially between countries who have had a peace agreement for 41 years. Once enemies, the two states have worked closely on security issues since the 1979 treaty and also to enforce a blockade in Gaza, the Palestinian enclave with which they both share a frontier. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post newspaper called on its government to go even further than a rather bland statement, citing a clause in the peace treaty that states the two sides would abstain from hostile propaganda against each other.. The 30-episode series is made by Synergy, which has ties with the government of President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and airs on the ON television network, which is owned by a pro-government company. Shows like these could not be aired without at least a wink from Cairo, the Jerusalem Post article said. El-Nehaya is one of many dramas and soap operas that launched during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan when people typically stay at home and watch television while fasting. Its scriptwriter, Amr Samir Atif, told the Associated Press that the destruction of Israel is a possible future in the absence of real peace and true stability in the region. Peace should be based on justice. There was no comment from the Egyptian government. It is not the first Egyptian series to anger Israel. In 2002, Horseman Without a Horse, which depicted the Arab fight against the establishment of the state of Israel, but included antisemitic cliches about Jewish conspiracies for world domination. Washington also complained at the time, saying it was a programme that promotes hatred.   Related: Ramadan TV dramas signal shift in Arab-Israeli relations   Other Ramadan shows this year have broken ground for the opposite message to El-Nehaya  highlighting the normalisation of some Middle Eastern countries relations with Israel. In one Saudi drama, Exit 7, a character questioned whether Israel should remain an enemy and if Riyadhs support for a Palestinian state had been fruitless. The show was seen as mirroring the position of Saudi Arabias government, which has increased ties with Israel, partly due to their shared arch-enemy, Iran.","478"
"2020-05-01T04:00:14Z","world","World news","Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria","Governments were caught out when Covid-19 hit, having overlooked the need to be able to test for new diseases because they were focused on drugs and vaccines for those they already knew about. Now there are fears that the rush to supply wealthier countries pressing for more tests may destabilise the fight against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, illnesses that kill millions, mostly in low- and middle-income countries.  Some companies are planning to reduce or stop malaria, HIV and TB test production, said Dr Catharina Boehme, the chief executive of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find) and an adviser to the World Health Organization. They are shifting their production to Covid-19 tests. Boehme said companies could get about 18 cents for a rapid malaria test and $10 for a Covid-19 test. The Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria said it was concerned about any action that might reduce the availability of tests or treatment for HIV, TB or malaria.  Its executive director, Peter Sands, said: Given the risk that Covid-19 undermines our continued progress in the fight against existing epidemics, this is not the time to be to doing anything that weakens our ability to diagnose and treat those infected with HIV, TB and malaria in a timely and cost-effective way. Doing so would cost lives. Diagnostics has been the poor relation to drugs and vaccines for years, as governments are now realising to their cost. The handful of countries that had specialised in diagnostics, including South Korea and Singapore, have had remarkable success in containing their epidemics. They were at a massive advantage. South Korea and Singapore both have a super strong diagnostics industry. Samsung, for example, has a diagnostics branch. A lot of the tech companies that we know more from mobile phones and so on have diagnostic branches, said Boehme. South Korea has factories that make tests for US and European companies. In Singapore, Sars was a wake-up call. In the aftermath, the government recognised an opportunity and invested in the diagnostics industry. Diagnostics are much more complicated than drugs and vaccines. India, which mass-produces cheap generic drugs for the world, does not have big diagnostics production. Germany, which has done more tests than any other country, got off to a flying start thanks to the virologist Christian Drosten, who produced the first test for Covid-19, backed by the WHO. In the UK, Public Health England took longer. Usually the Centers for Disease Control in the US is first off the blocks with new tests, but its did not work. It failed to pick up enough cases and also produced false positives. Germany had a large and excellent laboratory network and the advantage of being decentralised, so it could respond to outbreaks with extensive testing done on on a regional and local basis. By the time the UK decided to ramp up testing, it had similar problems as developing nations. There were stock-outs of testing kits and chemicals.  Smaller nations had less trouble obtaining what they needed. The UK is one of the largest countries. If they hadnt ordered large enough amounts early enough, they would have lost out, said Boehme. One of the handful of big companies with a US- and European-approved Covid-19 test is the BGI Group, a Chinese company that established testing in Wuhan at the start of the pandemic and then set up labs and testing in 11 other cities, which helped China get control of the outbreak. It was also involved in producing Ebola tests for Africa. It supplies coronavirus tests to Sweden, and one of its companies, MGI, recently agreed to supply 2m tests to France. MGI has also offered to help the UK. We want to help. Our manufacturing capacity now is 2m tests per day and we are ramping up to meet demand as we see it, said Perla El Hage, MGIs district sales manager for northern and western Europe. Find is working with the WHO, Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Gates and Clinton foundations to obtain Covid-19 tests for low-income countries. It has a storage facility in Dubai. BGI is one of the companies that has helped, but the scale of need is a challenge. We need an estimated 1bn tests in the next 12 months for low- and middle-income countries, said Boehme. Rapid diagnostic tests would be the ideal in terms of ease of use and price, but right now there is still a WHO recommendation against them because we lack evidence.    The diagnostic tests identify an antigen in the virus, rather than the antibodies that the immune system may produce to fight it off. Like the antibody tests, they can be handheld tests that do not need lab processing. We need tests that are at least 90% sensitive. The ongoing evaluation studies will show where we are. The sooner we can get these tests out, the better, said Boehme. Diagnostics are finally having their moment. On Monday there will be an international pledging conference for donor countries to promise funds for vaccines and work on epidemic preparedness. This time, it will include diagnostics. There is recognition of the crucial part they play in controlling a global pandemic, and acknowledgement that most countries have been very ill-prepared.","874"

Related: Trump stops hyping hydroxychloroquine after study shows no benefit   There is building anticipation over the content of an upcoming whistleblower complaint by Dr Rick Bright, who last week was abruptly removed as the head of the federal government office working on a vaccine for Covid-19. It is understood that Bright is still working on the details of the complaint before lodging it with the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general. Bright, a vaccines expert, has claimed he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) because he resisted an effort to expand the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19. The drugs, approved to treat malaria, have yet to be proven effective for this new use but have been repeatedly promoted by Trump, who has called them a game-changer. I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science  not politics or cronyism  has to lead the way, Bright said in a statement, adding he was concerned about efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections.    Dr Rick Bright, the former head of Barda. Photograph: Reuters   Brights lawyers, Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, subsequently claimed their client was pushed out of his job solely because he resisted efforts to provide unfettered access to potentially dangerous drugs, including chloroquine, a drug promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which is untested and possibly deadly when used improperly. It is expected that Brights complaint, when revealed, will shed new light on the political pressure exerted by the Trump administration on health officials to back up the presidents sweeping praise of the drugs as a key weapon against Covid-19. According to reporting by outlets including Vanity Fair, administration officials pushed for the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, despite the FDAs warnings, while also formulating a narrative where Bright was shifted from his role after mistreating his staff. His lawyers reject this characterization. The battle between Trump and an obscure official who was in charge of a little-known office is set to touch upon broader themes that have repeatedly cropped up during this presidency, specifically the treatment of scientific advice and the use of the federal government to promote the personal views of the president over experts. Dr Bright is a strong scientist, he is a visionary leader, hes able to make decisions, he get things done, and he believes and he stands on strong science, Nicole Lurie, former assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN. I think this is about something larger than hydroxychloroquine. I think its really about listening to scientific opinion, scientific perspective and standing up for strong science. Top officials at the Department of Health and Human Services have disputed Brights account, pointing out that he has been moved to an important role managing a public-private partnership on vaccine development and treatment. When asked about Bright, Trump said that he had never heard of the man heading the effort to find a vaccine for a virus that has already caused more than 60,000 deaths in the US. The president has repeatedly advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine following a small-scale study in France that showed some patients with Covid-19 responded well after taking it. However, further studies have shown mixed or negative results, with research linking it to heart problems and other serious conditions if not administered properly. Trump said on 19 March the drug could be really incredible in the fight against coronavirus and by that evening first-time prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine were 46 times the rate of the average weekday, according to one analysis. The surge in demand for the drug worried public health experts about serious harm arising from its use, as well as about people with conditions like lupus  a proven target for hydroxychloroquine  facing a shortage in supply. Two days after Bright announcing his planned whistleblower complaint, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning against the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The drugs, the regulator warned, can cause a number of side-effects including serious heart rhythm problems that can be life-threatening. The FDA issued an emergency use order to allow the drugs to be used in hospitals under certain conditions but the regulator said they should not be used outside this context. Clinical trials to establish safe use of drugs for new purposes usually take several years, a process chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have not gone through. The drugs, the FDA states, have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19.","776"

Were going to see where it comes from, Trump said at a White House event on Thursday. We have people looking at it very, very strongly. Scientific people, intelligence people, and others. Were going to put it all together. I think we will have a very good answer eventually. And China might even tell us.
Pressed to explain what evidence he had seen that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, Trump responded, I cant tell you that. Im not allowed to tell you that.
Prior to the White House event, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of US spy agencies, issued a statement asserting that the intelligence community concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.
The intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, the statement added.
Trumps comments came as global infections passed 3.25 million, a third of which were in the US, and where the death toll was approaching 63,000. Recoveries worldwide have passed 1 million.

The US president is increasingly making Beijings handling of the outbreak a major issue for his November re-election campaign and has repeatedly threatened retaliation against Beijing.
 The president and his allies have repeatedly touted the theory  for which there is no evidence  that an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, the center of the Chinese outbreak, was the source of the global pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 worldwide.
The World Health Organizations representative in China, Gauden Galea, said the organisation has made requests of Chinese authorities to join research into the origins of the virus. We know that some national investigation is happening but at this stage we have not been invited to join, he told Sky News in remarks published on Thursday.
He said the WHO has not been able to look at logs from two laboratories in Wuhan that were working on viruses but that researchers are convinced the disease was not manufactured.
From all available evidence, WHO colleagues in our three-level system are convinced that the origins are in Wuhan and that it is a naturally occurring, not a manufactured, virus, he said.
On Friday, Australias prime minister, Scott Morrison, said: What we have before us doesnt suggest that (a lab in Wuhan) is a likely source. His government has called for an objective assessment into the virus and its spread by an independent international team. 
Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said earlier this month that the mere fact that we dont know the answers that China hasnt shared the answers I think is very, very telling. Pompeo pressed China to let outside experts into the lab so that we can determine precisely where this virus began.
Scientists say the virus arose naturally in bats. Even so, Pompeo and others have pointed fingers at an institute that is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has done groundbreaking research tracing the likely origins of the Sars virus, finding new bat viruses and discovering how they could jump to people.
We know that there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was, Pompeo said two weeks ago. The institute has an address eight miles, or 13 km, from the market.
US officials say the American embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018 but have yet to find any evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later.
After initially praising the Chinese governments handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has reversed course in recent weeks, blaming China for not containing the virus more quickly.
 On Thursday Trump said: I dont want to cast any dispersions [sic], I just will tell you that China would like to see sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential election in November. China doesnt want to see me re-elected.

The presidents recent attacks on China line up with leaked Republican party memos, published by Politico, encouraging candidates to aggressively target Beijing in their public remarks on the pandemic.
The Chinese government said on Thursday that any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory were unfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing.The foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang cited the institutes director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen.
Geng also refuted Trumps claim that China was attempting to meddle in the US election. The US presidential election is an internal affair, we have no interest in interfering in it, he said.
He also criticized US politicians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should spend their time on better controlling the epidemic situation at home.
In an op-ed published on Thursday, editor of the state-run Global Times, Hu Xijin, labelled Trumps focus on China a stunt to divert Americans rage towards his administrations own incompetence in fighting the virus.
Only by making Americans hate China can they make sure that the public might overlook the fact that Trumps team is stained with the blood of Americans, said Hu.

The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic changed all of that. General practice is being attacked from all fronts  the years of neglect by successive federal governments leaving primary care struggling to cope with the challenges of a pandemic. There is an irony to the government thanking our frontline workers, promising that there are stockpiles of magical personal protective equipment (PPE) somewhere just waiting to be handed out, contrasting with the bleak reality of seeing face to face consults often without a mask, gown or goggles.
To date my surgery has received 100 surgical face masks and 20 N95 masks. This was two months ago.

GPs are constantly reminded that we are part of the frontline, that we should be testing for Covid-19, that we should be seeing common colds and flus and picking up the pieces of deteriorating mental health and burden of cancelled elective surgeries. It was ambitious to expect private small businesses (GP clinics) and self-employed contractors (individual GPs) to move with the rapidly changing environment without clear government support.
This has only been possible through the innovation of practice owners and doctors in sourcing their own protective equipment, including respirators and face shields from Bunnings, and banding together to support each other through conflicting guidelines form state and federal health departments.
The vast majority of my patients have been highly cooperative, respectful and accepting of their civic duty to ensure the safety of not only themselves but the community. There have been exceptions though: patients who demand to be tested despite not meeting guidelines; employers demanding clearance certificates when told that is not possible; patients abusing reception staff when told the flu shot is not in stock yet or otherwise demanding that they be able to have it for free when clearly not eligible. Perhaps the most disappointing is patients ignorantly or wilfully exposing other patients and the staff to potential infection by not being truthful when asked screening questions, but telling you of their sore throat, runny nose or cough only in the consulting room. This is why some GPs choose not to see patients face to face. They have their own families and health to look after too.


How efficient would more prevention be in our healthcare system?


One positive out of this pandemic has been the introduction of telehealth consults. It has allowed our vulnerable doctors to continue practising from home and our vulnerable patients to continue receiving care without putting themselves at risk. It has been something that has been called for by doctors of all specialties for years. 
Disappointingly, along with the new telehealth item numbers, I have noticed my Facebook feed littered with ads for telehealth GPs offering anything from a mens health check to referrals, scripts or medical certificates. To them it is an opportunity for business but in reality it is just further fragmentation of care. Of course the convenience is appealing, but is it safe?







I have always been cranky with my receptionists when they fit in a patient for just a script, just a medical certificate or just a referral. To me it is an opportunity for preventative care, to do blood pressures, check on routine bloods and cancer screening and to address little problems before they become bigger ones. These are opportunities that could not have been done with pop-up telehealth services but I am glad to be able to continue to do so as a GP. This continuity of care is highlighted by how efficient a telehealth consult is on a regular patient. Similarly, the Pharmacy Guild of Australias advocacy to push community pharmacists to do flu shots, prescribe the contraceptive pill, or antibiotics for a urinary tract infection, are further attempts to fragment care  an appealing business decision at the expense of patient care.
The potential collapse of GP practices with the downturn in patients has been highlighted in the media recently. This is not an issue unique to Covid-19 but one that it has accelerated. Medicare item numbers for GP consults were frozen from 2013 to 2018, with increases afterwards that are tokenistic at best. It is the reason why practices struggle to maintain bulk billing rates, as the burden of paying for increasing overheads, staff and medical supplies means that charging a gap is necessary for survival. Even when telehealth was introduced it was forbidden to charge a gap  effectively halving practice incomes on top of the downturn in patients. It is not a surprise that practices are struggling to stay afloat.

Funding general practice doesnt win votes. But I love keeping patients out of hospital, finding their cancers early or preventing their heart attacks. Id rather cut out a melanoma in its early stages than be the oncologist treating the melanoma that has already spread. How efficient would more prevention be in our healthcare system?
Even with Covid-19 , we could have engaged GP practices, armed with PPE, swabs and training, to roll out testing, public health education and prevent community spread early on. Why has the emphasis on funding been on hospitals, intensive care units and ventilators?
GPs are being asked to weather the storm, fight on minimal funding and look after their community. The freezing of MBS rates, the lack of frontline support and the fragmentation of primary care to pharmacies and telehealth corporates  this is wave after wave of insults that I fear the profession cannot take much longer. Many GPs are already leaving the profession. Some are only staying for the sake of their patients. There is a struggle to attract new trainees.
Something needs to change. We cannot wait for the profession to succumb before we finally realise the importance of primary care to our nations health.

About three quarters of the funds members work in construction, which has so far been spared a shutdown, avoiding mass unemployment in the sector.
This means the fund has been less affected by withdrawals than funds such as Hostplus and Rest, which draw much of their membership from the devastated hospitality or retail sectors.
Fok said withdrawals by Cbus members as the coronavirus hit had initially peaked at about $128m a day but had since subsided to the high 20 millions a day.
He said the funds first investment priority was saving businesses and jobs.
So, strong businesses that have got cashflow problems because of the shutdown but remain, in the long term, high quality businesses, are now seeking to recapitalise, he said.

He said Cbus would then look to invest in a pipeline of projects backed by governments, including its existing Bright Energy renewables joint venture in Western Australia and affordable housing financed by the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation.

Itll be clearly dependent on the finances of both the federal government and the state governments, he said.

Its exciting but we dont want to turn our lives into a rotating door of visits and visitors, because there is still risk out there. One of the people whos been quite persistent in inviting us over lives nearby, and volunteers for the same organisation as me. But geography is where the closeness ends  we dont have that much in common and, face to face, our conversations are often awkward. If were going to expand our small circle we want to prioritise people we like better. Is there a polite way of telling someone we dont want them in our bubble?Eleanor says: Ive been waiting for this moment, the one where our reaction to the risk starts to change, even though the risk itself stays more or less the same. In normal circumstances we expect our reactions to have a half-life: when theres a fact we cant change, like she left me or I didnt get the promotion, theres a point when were meant to move on. But when the fact is an ongoing risk, instead of something that recedes into the past, its not clear how long our reactions should last. We dont know what the half-life of fear is meant to be. To some of us it feels as though the fear should be dissolving by now: weve had the big reaction, weve processed the horror and, like any other grief or upheaval, theres a point where we need to return to normalcy. But for others it doesnt make sense to think in terms of an arc towards normalcy. This was not, in the first instance, a narrative point for us to integrate. Its just a virus, and a virus can kill you wherever youre up to in emotionally processing it. This split means a lot of us will be asking your question in the next month. Well move at different paces towards deciding that this mortal risk can fade to the background, along with all the other death risks that we dont structure our lives around, such as plane crashes and heart attacks. When our friends and family let it fade faster than we have, how can we politely maintain our own still-reasonable fear and the decisions that come from it?   Related: 'Self-isolation is bringing out the worst in some. How do we avoid conflict?'   One useful thing to keep in your arsenal is the move of expressing a preference while not insisting on its reasonableness. People might interpret your more careful approach to social distancing as an attack on their more relaxed one, but you can get ahead of that defensiveness by not presenting your preferences as the objectively right ones. Slight self-effacement about your decision may be your friend: Thank you so much for thinking of us, but were still being overly cautious about social distancing. Or you could exploit the fact that these decisions have to be made in household-sized units, and be vague about whose decision it was to decline this particular invitation: Some of us arent feeling quite ready for full social contact yet. This is a rare moment when excluding people from our social groups doesnt need to be solely a function of the fact we dont like them. Normally declining invitations communicates that, and thats what makes it so tricky. But this time, they can posit any number of explanations for why youve said no. Maybe youre still scared; maybe youre close to someone with an autoimmune condition. If the way you decline doesnt gently imply that they dont make the inner circle, theyre unlikely to conclude thats why you said no. This is an opportunity for you and your neighbours to handle each others approaches with grace. Try not to dodge it with an outright lie, tempting as that is  we all need to practice this kind of interaction, because the next few months are going to be filled with them. None of us know how long fear takes to decay. All we can do is be kind to each other despite our different answers.

"2020-05-01T01:35:06Z","world","World news","If Australia and New Zealand restart travel, they should include the Pacific in their bubble","As Australia and New Zealand tentatively celebrate successes in their battles to bring Covid-19 under control, Winston Peters, New Zealands deputy prime minister, has raised the possibility of the two nations opening up travel to one another. The mooted trans-Tasman bubble would allow travel between these two countries, which seem  for now  to have brought infection rates under control, while keeping their borders with the rest of the world closed or tightly managed. While this seems like an excellent idea, it is one that needs go further. Specifically this spirit of neighbourliness needs to be extended to the small island states of the Pacific. Aside from giving real substance to Canberras talk of a step-up in the region, if managed carefully, medically there is little to lose and economically there is much to gain from this approach.   Related: 'It's catastrophic': Fiji's colossal tourism sector devastated by coronavirus   Pacific nations have been successful in preventing the spread of Covid-19 within their territories. American Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands and Frances Pacific territories have reported cases, as have Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste, but of the independent island states only Fiji has been more exposed  18 cases with no deaths and no new infections in more than a week. Once eradicated, there is no rational case for not allowing travel to and from Pacific Island states to Australia and New Zealand, should this be something that Pacific nations want. Expanding a potential trans-Tasman bubble to the Pacific could help to stop its tourist industry from withering on the vine. Vanuatu, Fiji, Palau and the Cook Islands are all friends who depend upon Australian and New Zealand visitors for a substantial part of their economy, and we should not be leaving them out to dry now. The impact on these nations from the lack of international tourists has already been devastating. In Fiji, where tourism contributes nearly 40% of GDP, nearly 300 hotel and resorts have closed, and tens of thousands of people have already lost their jobs. A recent survey of more than 250 tourism businesses in Vanuatu suggested drops of 70% of full-time and 33% of part-time employment in the sector as a result of Covid-19 impacts. Going the other way, the Pacific has become an important source of seasonal harvest labour for Australia and New Zealand, and reopening the borders is one way of maintaining this. During the financial year 2018-19, some 12,000 workers from the region spent time in Australia as part of the Seasonal Worker Program (SWP), and if it hadnt been for the pandemic the numbers would have been even higher this year. The issue of whether or not the closure of borders will disrupt Australias food supply-chain is complicated. Some farmers report being overwhelmed by trapped backpackers, others worry that if borders remain closed into the latter half of 2020, fruit and veg may go unpicked. News that seasonal workers currently in Australia can extend their visas by a year is welcome, but a temporary fix. Especially when we factor in the importance that remittances from Australia have for many households in places like Vanuatu and Tonga the case for reopening the gates to seasonal workers, and perhaps even expanding the SWP is a strong one. While supporting Pacific households and Australian farms are excellent reasons to advocate for opening our borders to Pacific Island states one aspect of this issue that does require some soul-searching is the degree to which such action would also be motivated by a spirit of competition with China. Some have argued that a trans-Pacific bubble could be a way of strengthening Australias strategic interest in the region as China is making its presence felt there. Common as such reasoning may be, the spirit of it is not in anyones best interest, especially at a time of acute crisis. Anti-Chinese sentiment has a long history in both Australia and the Pacific and responsible policy-makers must not give oxygen to some of the paranoid rubbish that is out there. The question Australians need to be asking themselves is not how we can compete with China but how we might cooperate with it to help our more neighbours through an economic storm theyre ill-equipped to weather. Without a doubt reopening our borders to the Covid-19 clear nations of the Pacific would pose more of a challenge than setting up a trans-Tansman bubble. Great care would need to be taken to work with Pacific governments and communities to ensure their great work at keeping the virus out was not undermined and any inclusion would have to be at the invitation of Pacific governments. Yesterday Matangi Tonga reported that Tongas top health official, Siale Akauola said Tonga was not ready to reopen borders and when it did it would be first to countries with no recorded cases of the virus, such as Samoa and Vanuatu. However if Pacific nations wanted it, their inclusion in a trans-Pacific, rather than trans-Tasman travel bubble could be an act of goodwill that would better the lives of thousands and be appreciated for decades to come.

"2020-05-01T01:32:53Z","culture","Culture","Younger: shrewd take on millennial publishing ticks the romcom boxes too","The plight of the romantic comedy over the past decade has, for me, been painful to watch. Once a staple of the multiplex, low-to-mid-budget romcoms in the vein of Suddenly 30 or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days have all but disappeared from screens, replaced by gross-out bro comedies, superhero movies, and, on the other end of the spectrum, important films. Most people probably dont yearn for another Legally Blonde, but for someone like me  whose childhood was filled with DVD screenings of ultra-saturated stories of hardened career girls and their quests for love  theres nothing like a humble romcom. Films like Bridget Jones Diary and Monster-in-Law, with their perfect blend of cynicism and fairytale serendipity, shaped my personality more than Id care to admit.   Related: Love is (still) in the air: how the romcom came back from the dead   Finding something to fill the void was hard  until I stumbled across the TV show Younger. Created by Sex and the Citys Darren Star, Younger ticks all the boxes on my perfect romcom checklist: it has a bizarre premise (a 40-something divorcee, played by Sutton Foster, pretends to be 27 in order to get a publishing job); a cast of quirky gal-pals (Hillary Duff as a savvy careerist, Molly Bernard as a wacky publicist, Debi Mazar as a wise lesbian artist); a saucy love triangle (Fosters Liza is caught between her staid, enigmatic CEO, and a sensitive, chiseled tattoo artist); and a hardened-but-caring boss, played hilariously by Miriam Shor.    Molly Bernard, Hillary Duff and Sutton Foster in season four of Younger. Photograph: Stan   Like all the best romcoms, the shows leads have entry-level jobs in a dying industry (in this case, publishing), but can somehow afford designer outfits and glamorous Williamsburg lofts; they attend parties every evening and still manage to find time to read thousand-page manuscripts and marketing plans. In Youngers version of publishing, business meetings are more often than not excuses to drink heavily or dive into a rooftop pool, and signing an author often involves going on a few dates with them, too. Younger is a fairytale, and its all the better for it. And like many from the genres Golden Age (roughly 200108, in my estimation), the show also provides a slyly salient critique of the feminist mores of its time. In the same way that Bridget Jones Diary smartly found comedy in the tension between its title characters desire for a romantic partner and her desire to not need a romantic partner  in the process skewering the concept of Having It All  Younger picks apart the corporatisation of identity politics with a surprisingly ruthless eye.   Related: Why romcoms have all the answers | Eva Wiseman   Many episodes introduce thinly veiled stand-ins for feminist authors like Lena Dunham and Cat Marnell, using them as an opportunity to expose the narcissism that often underscored 2010s girl-boss feminism; other plot lines ponder why youthful activists seem to abhor every kind of discrimination except ageism, the bogeyman that follows Liza around every corner in the form of new fads and social standards. One particularly great episode involves Duffs character Kelsey attending a networking function at feminist co-working space The Nest, only to find that its more of an opportunity for rich attendees to shill their products and talk up their credentials than an opportunity to connect. The episode aired years before a New York Times expose alleged that The Nests real-life analogue, The Wing, was doing the same thing. Its this tonal sweet-spot  shrewd where it counts, blithely far-fetched everywhere else  that keeps me coming back to Younger. At its worst, its still a well-acted, delightfully lightweight confection; at its sharpest, it feels strangely essential, carrying the torch of the best 2000s romcoms and forging a new path for mid-budget, female-centric comedies. For me, the romantic comedy is, sadly, dead. Long live Younger.  Younger is streaming in Australia on Stan","616"

Traditionally, the talking heads on Sky  ex-politicians, journalists and commentators  were variously paid between $200 and $250 to chat to the likes of Andrew Bolt, Alan Jones and Chris Kenny. Many of the journalists who appear on Sky programs are News Corp employees, some of whom were paid on top of their salary to do the TV spot.

Sky has told regulars they can appear for nothing or not at all, but no one will be paid for the rest of the year. The ABC generally does not pay journalists to do spots, except for Insiders, which used to require a flight to Melbourne, and some spots on Radio Nationals Breakfast program with Fran Kelly. Some Insiders guests say they would love to continue appearing remotely to avoid a weekend of travel, but it is not something the program is considering when normal business is resumed.  The Sky cutbacks come just as the station is celebrating a surge in viewers, especially for its dedicated 24/7 Sky News Covid-19 channel, where viewing figures are up 406% since it started streaming free online on News Corp websites.

Another 70 positions were made redundant on Thursday, on top of the 200 last month and a number from Fox Sports before that. Foxtel has been hit hard by the cancellation of live sport during the pandemic as fans cancelled their Foxtel and Kayo subscriptions despite attempts to offer sweeteners to stay. These are changes we had to make to face up to the impacts of Covid-19 on our business and a very different future for everyone involved in the media, entertainment and sporting industries, a spokesman said.Despite losing more than 10% of its workforce, Foxtel is planning to launch a new stand-alone streaming service, similar to sports service Kayo, in a matter of weeks. The new service to compete with Netflix, Stan, Amazon Prime, Disney and Apple TV+ is to be called Binge. The name has been used before by Foxtel, for a drama and comedy channel on the platform between 2016 and 2019, before it was replaced by Fox One. Bauer wields the axe Another 70 media workers lost their jobs this week after German magazine giant Bauer Media restructured its Australian operation, which publishes the Australian Womens Weekly and Womans Day, among many other historic titles. The news came at the 11th hour before Bauer was due to finalise a merger with Pacific Magazines, the magazine publishing arm owned by Seven West Media. On Friday morning Bauer announced the $40m deal, which will unite the two rivals after decades of competition, had gone ahead. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission did not oppose the merger, saying in March that it was unlikely to substantially lessen competition in any market despite the close rivalry between Womans Day (Bauer) and New Idea (Pacific), and Take 5 (Bauer) and Thats Life! (Pacific). A further 70 staff have been stood down at Bauer as it suspends printing of certain titles. Making the announcement to a shellshocked workforce via video conference on Wednesday, the company refused to say which magazines had been suspended, but Weekly Beast understands the four magazines to cease printing are NW, OK!, Elle and Harpers Bazaar. Staff were told they were out of work for at least eight weeks. They will be paid until the end of next week, and can take their annual leave, but otherwise will be unpaid. Staff left out of jobkeeper There was another sting in the tail for the Bauer staff who were stood down. The company says they are not eligible for the federal governments jobkeeper program, which pays employers $1,500 a fortnight to keep staff in work during the pandemic. The companys global structure means the employees dont qualify. Sources say the company chose the four titles because they are not profitable without advertising, as they have smaller circulations than the stronger titles such as Australian Womens Weekly, Take 5, TV Week and Womans Day. While the websites will continue to operate, Bauer said rather ominously that any decision to resume print publication will be made once the trading environment improves. Staff are hoping they will come back onboard in a couple of months, but have to face the possibility they may not.

Biden, the presumptive nominee, will respond for the first time to the recent allegation of sexual assault, the network announced in a tweet on Thursday. Tara Reade came forward last month to accuse Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of Capitol Hill office building when she worked in his Senate office in the spring of 1993. Bidens campaign has forcefully denied the allegation, but the candidate has not commented personally. Bidens interview on Morning Joe, a cable news talk show, comes after new evidence emerged this week corroborating aspects of Reades story, which has escalated along partisan lines.   Related: Pressure mounts on Joe Biden to address sexual assault claim   In recent days, Biden has faced mounting calls from some Democrats to make a public statement, even as the partys leadership stands behind him. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker on Thursday stressed her support for Bidens nomination while Republicans seized the opportunity to attack Biden and his record ahead of a general election against Donald Trump, who has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by more than a dozen women, all of which he has denied. The issue has forced Democrats into an increasingly uncomfortable position as they grapple with how to respond in a way that is consistent with their support for the #MeToo movement. The partys leadership has so far supported Biden, defending his character and pointing to his legislative record on sexual violence policy. Already, top female surrogates and allies, including potential vice presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Stacey Abrams, have been asked whether they stand by him. Yet he has not been asked about it in the dozens of television interviews, virtual town halls or donor events hes participated in. Some progressive activists have called on Biden to step down as the party nominee while advocates for victims of sexual assault have been disappointed by the handling of Reades claim by Bidens campaign and the press. The issue was not raised on Thursday during an Instagram live event with soccer star Megan Rapinoe, a prominent advocate of equal pay and gender equality. Yet several viewers posted comments during the livestream urging Rapinoe to ask Biden about the allegation. On Thursday, Pelosi, the highest-ranking woman in American politics, sought to dispel any concern about Bidens candidacy. I want to remove all doubt in anyones mind: I have a great comfort level with the situation as I see it, with all due respect in the world for any woman who comes forward, with all the highest regard for Joe Biden, Pelosi told reporters on Thursday, adding that she had complete respect for the #MeToo movement. There is also due process, Pelosi said. And the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden. Republicans seized on the remark to accuse Pelosi and the party more broadly of hypocrisy on issues of sexual assault and harassment. They compared her response to the allegation against Biden to the accusation against Brett Kavanaugh during his supreme court confirmation hearing. Shes being a hypocrite, said Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader. You cant say one thing about every other time she has commented about any other accusation, and now say this is different. In an interview with Fox News, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said Biden should release his Senate papers to shed more light on the allegation, though he has not made a similar appeal for information related to the charges against Trump. The president also weighed in on the allegation on Thursday, calling on Biden to respond while conceding that the claim could be false. I know all about false accusations, he said. I have been falsely charged numerous times and there is such a thing. Still, Trumps campaign has made clear they intend to use Reades claim to undercut Biden, who has made character a central theme of his campaign against Trump. A Trump campaign memo published on Wednesday highlighted Bidens response to Reades claim and accused him of misrepresenting news reports and his own past positions in an effort to put controversies to bed or to level charges against the president.","709"
"2020-05-01T00:31:31Z","australia-news","Australia news","Remdesivir: five Australian hospitals to receive experimental coronavirus drug","The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir. The only confirmed location is St Vincents hospital in Sydney, a major tertiary hospital and the centre of many of the New South Wales outbreak areas. A NSW Health spokeswoman confirmed the health department has been engaging with Gilead on gaining access to the drug for Covid-19 patients. The news comes as the doctor informing the Covid-19 response in the White House, the immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, promoted preliminary findings from a joint Gilead and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that suggested remdesivir could improve recovery time of patients. His comments have revived global hope in the drug, with no treatments now available for the virus.   Related: Remdesivir: the antiviral drug is being touted as a possible coronavirus treatment  but will it work?   But experts have warned that the study findings are unpublished and preliminary. The US clinical trial registry also shows that Gilead altered the primary outcome measures of the trial halfway through. It broadened its definition of recovery and included patients who were still in hospital and who were at home but requiring oxygen in its group of recovered patients. Changing the primary outcomes of a study is often viewed by scientists with scepticism in any clinical trial, as it is often done to improve the significance of results after the initial outcomes proved disappointing. This is known as fishing for significance. Nine members of the US panel that establishes treatment guidelines have a financial interest in Gilead. A separate study from China published in the prestigious medical journal the Lancet showed no statistically clinical benefit in Covid-19 patients in health improvement or mortality after they were given remdesivir. But the researchers tested a smaller number of patients than the US trial and concluded that their findings would require confirmation from larger studies. The study was stopped early by the data safety monitoring board because of difficulty recruiting patients. Even if the drug does ultimately prove effective, it is likely to be used in a similar way to the influenza drug Tamiflu, shortening the duration of illness but not curing it. The US study showed patients given remdesivir improved only moderately, after an average of 11 days, compared with an average of 15 days for those not given the treatment. Dr Gaetan Burgio, head of the transgenesis facility at the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University in Canberra, said the studies so far revealed remdesivir is not a silver bullet against Covid-19. It is therefore more critical than ever to keep social distancing, wearing masks or follow other preventive measures to limit the spread and eliminate the virus, Burgio said. Prof Sarah Palmer, the co-director of the Centre for Virus Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Sydney, said: There is still a lot to learn about this disease. We cannot base our medical response on this one promising study. This drug is still in early clinical trials and is not currently widely available. It is possible depending upon a wide range of issues including, production, licensing, urgency that it will become available in Australia in the future.","526"

At the height of the crisis, a small, largely unknown Brisbane company, Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd, told the Australian government it could supply huge quantities of Covid-19 rapid antibody testing kits made by a relatively well-known Chinese manufacturer, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. Promedicals chief executive, Neran De Silva, was convicted of rape in 2018, and was a one-time business associate of the government services minister, Stuart Robert, through a cryotherapy treatment business. Promedicals two shares were purchased for $2 by De Silvas partner. Before the pandemic it sold cryogenic, massage therapy and erectile dysfunction machines. The Chinese-made Covid-19 testing kit it was offering to sell the Australian government was already approved for use in both Australia and the US. Promedical was effectively acting as a distributor.   Sign up for Guardian Australias daily coronavirus email newsletter  The Guardian can reveal the Australian government signed a contract with Promedical to supply it with 500,000 antibody testing kits in March, as it urgently attempted to boost its capacity to screen for Covid-19. Promedical and its representatives were on a media blitz about the same time, telling The Today Show, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Sky News it could supply 5m tests to Australia every week, an announcement heralded as revolutionary and amazing. But the deal between Promedical and its Chinese manufacturer broke down in acrimonious fashion.   Related: Clive Palmer ad for coronavirus 'cure' cleared by Australian drug regulator   Wondfo effectively disowned the Brisbane company, revoking authorisation to distribute its products in early April. Promedical has not delivered any of the Wondfo tests, the government said, nor had they been paid for. A health department spokeswoman said its contract with Promedical stipulated it would only be paid once the tests were received. No money had been given to Promedical, she said. The contract was for payment on delivery and acceptance of the testing kits. On 3 April, the department was advised that the Chinese manufacturer Wondfu had withdrawn its permission for Promedical to distribute their device, she said. To date, the tests have not arrived in Australia and no payment has been made. Promedical blamed Wondfo and claimed the manufacturer was unable to meet order quantities by the deadlines specified. Promedical continued to secure orders with government bodies for quantities far larger than those Wondfo could produce within the tight timeframe, a spokeswoman said. On 3 April 2020, it was evident Wondfo could not supply the required quantities of its Covid-19 IgG Rapid Detection Kit to fill Promedicals Australian government [order]. Promedical says it is planning to supply its own branded Covid-19 testing kits to the government. But that test does not appear on the Therapeutic Goods Administrations list of approved Covid-19 tests. A Promedical spokeswoman said the government had been made aware of changes to the delivery timeline as a result of the changes to supplier. The company said it had received assurances from the Australian government that it would proceed with the contract. Promedicals contact with the Australian government has confirmed that, as long as Promedicals Covid-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Detection Kit is included in the TGAs [Australian register of therapeutic goods], they will continue with the order and quantities, in line with an updated contract, a Promedical spokeswoman said. The government has cast serious doubt on that claim. A health department spokeswoman said: No further action is being taken by the department in regard to the contract for any new or additional testing kits that may be sourced by Promedical. The Guardian has previously revealed that the TGA is investigating Promedicals actions. Even when its deal with Wondfo broke down, it continued to falsely claim in promotional material that the Covid-19 testing kits it was selling had Australian and US regulatory approval. Promedical told the Guardian it had now updated its communications to provide further clarification for buyers. The pandemic has put huge pressure on governments to urgently approve medical devices to boost testing capacity amid unprecedented demand.   Related: A quick return to normal in Australia  with no Covid-19 vaccine  would risk lives and the economy | Chris Edmond and Richard Holden   In Australia, the TGA is treating requests for approval with urgency and then conducting post-market surveillance to ensure they are accurate and reliable. The medical regulator says any Australian-based legal entity may be the sponsor of a medical device, provided it can fulfil legislative requirements, including being able to demonstrate adequate safety and performance. When Promedical was asked whether it had any prior experience in medical diagnostics, a spokeswoman said the pandemic had seen businesses all over the world adapt and innovate like never before. When Covid-19 entered Australia, Promedical immediately began looking for the best solution to stop its spread; finding a way to speed up the testing and reporting process, she said. It also said it worked closely with regulatory bodies, including the TGA, and followed strict guidelines. The type of antibody testing offered by Promedical is generally used to supplement the primary form of Covid-19 testing, which examines genetic material in laboratories. Antibody testing is designed as a method of rapid screening, and experts say it has some utility in the response to the pandemic, but should not be relied upon as the sole diagnostic tool. Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert at the Australian National University, has previously told the Guardian the government must take care to prevent inaccurate antibody tests coming on to the market, despite the urgency of the crisis.","909"

But some early Covid-19 antibody tests, and the research that hinges on them, have been deeply flawed.

The president has recently been pushing the idea that Chinas handling of the coronavirus is proof that Beijing will do anything they can to make him lose his re-election bid in November. The Guardians Alison Rourke and Lily Kuo report:  In an interview with Reuters, the US president said he was looking at different options in terms of consequences for Beijing over the virus. I can do a lot, he said, without going into detail. Trump has increasingly blamed China for the pandemic and on Wednesday again said Beijing should have let the world know about the coronavirus much sooner. He also speculated about retaliation: There are many things I can do, he said. Were looking for what happened. For the first time, Trump linked Beijing to his re-election chances in November. China will do anything they can to have me lose this race, he said, adding that he believed China wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the race to ease the pressure on US-China trade relations. Theyre constantly using public relations to try to make it like theyre innocent parties, he said of Chinese officials.

Although this was not billed as a coronavirus briefing, like his White House event yesterday  it really seemed like one.  Trump veered off-topic, took questions from reporters, made the same misleading assertions hes made at previous coronavirus briefings ( Ive fact-checked a few of them below).  Before signing off the president wondered out loud whether he should wear a mask when he travels to Arizona next week, leaving Washington for the first time in more than a month, in order to visit a Honeywell aerospace facility that has transitioned to producing N-95 masks. Ill have to see the climate, Trump said, adding that he would have no problem wearing a mask. Should I speak in a mask? he asked. Is that politically correct?     10.39pm BST   A Democratic congressional candidate is arguing that a member of the committee in charge of overseeing stimulus money should step down over past comments she made on vaccines. The Guardians senior political reporter Daniel Strauss reports: The candidate, Democrat Suraj Patel, is running for New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloneys seat. On Wednesday, Maloney was appointed to the select committee on the coronavirus crisis, a new oversight committee.Heres Patels statement:  Carolyn Maloney spent decades as an anti-vaccine movement leader giving validity to a dangerous creed threatening public health and the most vulnerable.    The history of Maloneys anti-vaccine stances is long and dangerous: she authored ani-vaccine legislation; angrily berated a CDC Director during a congressional hearing because the CDC Director would not agree that vaccines cause autism; led a radical group of activists in a Green the Vaccine rally outside of the steps of Congress; hosted radical anti-vaccine activists in Congress; and regularly claimed vaccines were as dangerous as smoking.  It is dangerous and unthinkable to elevate her anti-science voice during the coronavirus crisis. The world is waiting on a vaccine to bring this horror to an end. This is no time to hand the mic to someone who endangers public health by questioning science. Appointing her to this position begs the question: How is a committee tasked with overseeing the development of a COVID-19 vaccine credible if Maloney, an anti-vaccine activist that questions the CDCs scientific findings on vaccines, is one of its leaders?  Now more than ever we need elected officials who trust doctors, medicine, and science. Maloney does not fit the bill. I call on Speaker Pelosi to remove Representative Maloney from the Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis sending a message to Americas doctors and scientists: we will always follow your lead.  Maloney, whos been a member of Congress for over 25 years, has had to walk back past statements questioning the safety of vaccines for children. In a 2012 congressional testimony on autism, according to the New York Post, Maloney said:  And youve got to listen, you know, to  I remember smoking. I was on the City Council. I sat through so many hearings where they vowed smoking was not bad for your health. Its common sense it was bad for your health...The same thing seems to be here with vaccinations. Theres too much verbal evidence coming from parents where they break down,[and say], I had a normal child, I gave him a vaccination, and then they came down with autism.  More recently a spokesperson for Maloney has said she does not believe theres a link between vaccinations and autism.On Wednesday Maloney was named by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to the bipartisan select committee on the coronavirus crisis. Maloney is one of seven Democrats named to the committee. The committee is a high profile perch for a member of Congress. It is charged with oversight of the coronavirus stimulus package passed in Congress.  Updated at 11.28pm BST    10.36pm BST   Fact check: Is the virus manmade? Trump said he cant say why, but hes confident that the coronavirus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But the office of the director of national intelligence has said the intelligence community does not believe coronavirus was manmade. In a statement, the Office of the DNI said: The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified. The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.   Updated at 11.26pm BST    10.22pm BST   Fact check: Travel ban  Trump says the US is very lucky that he enacted a travel ban on China and a ban on Europe. In fact, the administrations travel policy did not cut off all travel  from China. Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt. Similarly, Trumps European travel restrictions exempted citizens, residents and their families. And initially, the restrictions didnt apply to the UK and Ireland, as well as most Eastern European countries. Epidemiologists have told the Guardian that these policies likely had little impact, as they were enacted after the virus was already spreading within the US.Unfortunately, travel bans sound good, noted Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvards TH Chan School of Public Health, after Trump announced European restrictions. But were way past the point where simply restricting travel is a reasonable response. The few studies so far that have investigated the impact of travel restrictions have found that such policies may have at best delayed the spread of disease by a few days or weeks. A recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of Covid-19. And in China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report published in Science. But there is no evidence that travel restrictions ultimately stopped the spread of coronavirus, or significantly reduced the contagions death toll.

Scientists express skepticism    Updated at 11.20pm BST    10.20pm BST   Fact check: Testing The president, as hes done at multiple coronavirus press briefings, noted that the US has conducted about 6m coronavirus tests. You add up everybody together they dont add up to that, Trump said, implying, as hes done before that the US has done more testing than other countries combined.  This is not true. Countries around the world have together conducted more than 6m tests.  Moreover, while testing in the US has ramped up after an initially slow start, the US lags behind other countries in testing per capita. Currently, the US is testing about 1 in every 52 people.

Speaking at the White House, the 73-year-old president joked about his age, saying, I dont know if Im in that category. I have a feeling I am. But I feel good.  Trumps announcement comes as polls indicate that Americans who are 65 or older are increasingly critical of the presidents handling of the pandemic. Trump will need the support of older Americans to have any chance of winning the presidential election in November, so this proclamation is likely meant to appease some of his elderly supporters. In his speech announcing the proclamation, the president also took credit for a 2014 bill that was signed into law by Barack Obama.

There is a protest planned at Huntington Beach pier tomorrow at noon. @FOXLA— Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) April 30, 2020  While health experts hold firm on the importance of social distancing and hygiene, the reaction to beach closures has been mixed. This week, public health experts and epidemiologists told the Guardians Sam Levin that some of the backlash and concern may be unwarranted.  One public health professor said he was initially shocked by the photos showing densely packed beaches, but said it was possible that those who are grouped together could be from the same household. Other experts pointed out that some of the conditions at beaches  like salt water, sand and sunlight  could make it more difficult for the virus to spread from person to person. Experts say the virus doesnt survive long in ultraviolet light, although light cannot kill a virus already in the body, as Trump has suggested.  If allowing people to have access to sunshine and recreation is whats going to keep them from protesting and violating laws, that may be a trade-off worth making, said Wendy Parmet, a Northeastern University health policy expert.     9.30pm BST   Mike Pence said he found the governments treatment of Michael Flynn to be deeply troubling, as the president signals he is considering a possible pardon of his former national security adviser.

Newsom said that the previous, erroneous reports were not generated by his office and that hes been clear and consistent about his plans.   ""Bottom line, that was their memo, but that memo never got to me.

He urged Trump to Take responsibility. This is a national crisis. As Biden continued to rail against the presidents response, Jill Biden interjected: Lets not talk about him. Lets talk about us. A number of the comments on the livstream urged Rapinoe to ask Biden about the sexual assault allegation against him, a charge that his campaign has forcefully denied. The topic did not come up.

Safety restrictions for businesses will also remain in effect until at least May 13. What weve done has worked, Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Its given us time to build our hospital infrastructure capacity, get ventilators and ramp up testing. Thats what really drove our decision.  Kemp has received some criticism for allowing non-essential businesses like hair salons and barbershops to start reopening, raising concerns about a potential surge in coronavirus cases.

Biden is facing growing pressure to publicly address an allegation of sexual assault made by Tara Reade, a former aide to his Senate office.The former vice-president has remained silent about the accusation, a position that is seen as increasingly untenable in the wake of new reporting. Many major Democratic womens organizations and prominent feminists have also declined to comment publicly on Reades claim that Biden, then a senator from Delaware, assaulted her in 1993.

Several ship personnel came down with coronavirus while deployed to New York. A Pentagon spokesman called the ships departure a sure sign of modest progress in mitigating the virus in the nations hardest hit city and is a welcome sign. Governor Andrew Cuomo said last week that he and Donald Trump agreed the Comfort was no longer needed in New York City.I believe Comfort not only brought comfort but also saved lives, Cuomo said. The Comfort and its 620 doctors, nurses and other crew members will return to the homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, where the ship will be restocked and be readied for another possible assignment.  More than 18,000 people in the state have died from coronavirus, most of them in New York City. That total doesnt include more than 5,300 deaths in the city that were attributed to the virus on death certificates but werent confirmed by a lab test. The Defense Department said it did not have information on how much the Comforts mission to New York cost.The Comfort has a capacity of up to 1,000 hospital beds, but according to New York Citys Office of Emergency Management, it had 427 set up for the coronavirus crisis.  Updated at 7.45pm BST    6.30pm BST   Republican senator Rick Scott escalated his ongoing feud with New York governor Andrew Cuomo over additional funding for state governments.  The feud started earlier this week, when Scott wrote a Wall street Journal op-ed arguing government funding should not be used to save liberal politicians from the consequences of their poor choices. That sparked fury from Cuomo, who noted Scotts homestate of Florida is more reliant on federal funding than New York is. Theyre not bailing us out, Cuomo said. We bail them out every year.  Scott has now come out swinging again, saying in a new statement, Governor Cuomo used his daily briefing as an opportunity to attack me to distract from the fact that he wants his state bailed out by Florida taxpayers. Congressional leaders continue to spar over the details of the next coronavirus relief bill, but the National Governors Association has said states need another $500 billion.     6.00pm BST  Today so far  Heres where the day stands so far:  Another 3.8 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, according to new figures from the labor department. More than 30 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past six weeks as the economy suffers the effects of the pandemic. Trump claimed he had done a spectacular job handling the pandemic, despite widespread criticism of his administrations early response to the virus. The presidents comments come as the US coronavirus death toll stands at 61,288. The New York subway will close for nightly cleaning, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing. The transit system will be closed from 1 am to 5 am to thoroughly disinfect all subway cars.   The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.     5.54pm BST   The interim president of the New York City Transit system said the subway closures for nightly cleaning would be in effect for the duration of the pandemic.  NEW: Buses will NOT be included in the MTA service shutdown, but will be included in the disinfection/new cleaning protocols. Effective date is May 6 for subway shutdown. End date? @FeinbergSarah says for the duration of the pandemic.— Bernadette Hogan (@bern_hogan) April 30, 2020  The duration of the pandemic could be interpreted in a number of different ways, but if the plan remains in effect until a coronavirus vaccine is developed, the closures could last for several more months.     5.38pm BST  New York subway to close for nightly cleaning  The Guardians Kenya Evelyn with a recap of New York governor Andrew Cuomos daily press briefing: For the first time in decades, New York City will no longer be The City that never sleeps.  The governor, along with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, who patched in remotely, announced a partnership that the city will halt train service every night from 1 am to 5 am for disinfecting and cleaning.  Were going to find a way to make our subway system cleaner that it has ever been in its history, probably, de Blasio said. Its not going to be easy, no one said it would be easy. Cuomo and de Blasio have not had the warmest relationship, to say the least. The two leaders have not shared a stage together since 2 March, one day after New York reported its first confirmed coronavirus case. The governor reported that hospitalizations and new cases are down, and while 306 deaths are down from 330 Wednesday, Cuomo still called the number terrible. Optimist would say thats a number on the decline, realists would say thats a tremendous amount of grief for a loved one, he said. New York State had more than 300,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 18,000 deaths as of midday Thursday. Todays another day to be better and do better, Cuomo said. Before expanding on details of state tracing efforts, Cuomo reiterated that the key to reopening states is keeping the infection rate down and hospital capacity high. If we do this right, this is a science reopening, he said. Cuomo was also joined by former New York City mayor and Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Bloomberg, wholl lead the states case tracing efforts.

But the administration has been criticized for fumbling its early response to the virus by failing to make testing more widely available. Trump noted the US has now conducted more tests than any other country, but the country has still conducted far less tests per capita than Italy.     5.11pm BST   The Trump administration is reportedly considering retaliatory actions against China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The Washington Post reports:   Senior officials across multiple government agencies are expected to meet on Thursday to begin mapping out a strategy for seeking retaliatory measures against China, two people with knowledge of the meeting said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to disclose the planning. Officials in American intelligence agencies are also involved in the effort. ... In private, Trump and aides have discussed stripping China of its sovereign immunity, aiming to enable the U.S. government or victims to sue China for damages. George Sorial, who formerly served as a top executive at the Trump Organization and is now involved in a class-action lawsuit against China, told The Washington Post he and senior White House officials have discussed limiting Chinas sovereign immunity. Legal experts say an attempt to limit Chinas sovereign immunity would be extremely difficult to accomplish and may require Congressional legislation.   The president has repeatedly tried to deflect criticism of the White Houses early response to coronavirus by blaming China for not being forthcoming about the outbreak.      4.51pm BST   House speaker Nancy Pelosi was careful not to criticize Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for calling senators back to Washington starting next week. Pelosi and majority leader Steny Hoyer originally said the House would also return next week, but they reversed that decision after a consultation with the Capitols attending physician. Were 430 members, Pelosi said during her weekly briefing call. The decision was made on the strength of our numbers and people coming together. The speaker added, Now, what they advised the Senate, I dont know.

The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified, the statement reads. The statement added, The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan. Trump has reportedly asked intelligence officials to investigate whether coronavirus was created in a Chinese government laboratory, even though many public health experts have said they think the virus came about naturally.

Bidens team argued the agreement, which involves supporters of Sanders filling some delegate slots to reflect the results of primarie, would help to bring the party together before the convention. The campaign also specified that Sanders supporters would be represented in the New York delegation, even though the state canceled its primary. Bidens campaign said in a statement, While Senator Sanders is no longer actively seeking the nomination, the Biden campaign feels strongly that it is in the best interest of the party and the effort to defeat Donald Trump in November to come to an agreement regarding these issues that will ensure representation of Sanders supporters and delegate candidates, both on the floor and in committees. Sanders suspended his campaign earlier this month, but he had said he will remain on states ballots to continue to win delegates in order to influence the partys platform at the convention.     3.33pm BST   The Senates oldest member is urging majority leader Mitch McConnell to reconsider his decision to reconvene the chamber on Monday.  California senator Dianne Feinstein, who is 86, noted the House has backed off its initial plan to call members back to Washington next week. The Attending Physician of Congress, Dr. Brian Monahan, advised House leadership that he recommends against resuming their session, Feinstein said in a statement. Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer did the right thing by heeding this public health advice and are setting the right example for the country.  Thats why I ask the majority leader to reconsider his plan to reconvene the Senate. He would bring 100 senators and many more staff members and reporters into close proximity while Washington itself remains under a stay-at-home order. There is no way to do this without increased risk. This is the wrong example for the country.

TIME's new cover: How the real experts  scientists  are navigating the way out https://t.co/ZPhCnXiQWs pic.twitter.com/s6E7qYPjhr— TIME (@TIME) April 30, 2020  The magazines cover story dives into the potential danger of reopening the country too quickly:  There is both promise and peril in being a pioneer, and the people of Hokkaido have learned both lessons well over the past few months. After infections of COVID-19 on the Japanese island exploded following its annual winter festival this year, officials in February declared a state of emergency to control the disease. Soon after, new daily cases plummeted, and Hokkaidos quick action was heralded as a beacon for the rest of Japan to follow. But it wasnt just infections that dropped; over the next month, agriculture and tourism business also dried up, and Hokkaidos governor decided to ease social restrictions. However, compliance with limits on social interaction after weeks of sequestering was harder this time around. Within a month, Hokkaidos new COVID-19 infections jumped by 80%, and the governor had to reinstate lockdown policies. There are similar stories from Singapore, Hong Kong and Germany, and all serve as sobering lessons for the decision-makers in the U.S. who are under increasing pressure to reopen the country to reactivate its stalled economy.  The story comes as the federal guidelines aimed at limiting the spread of the virus are set to expire, and some governors are already taking steps to reopen their states, potentially risking another surge in coronavirus cases.

The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits and the numbers are still growing.  The latest figures from the labor department released on Thursday showed a fourth consecutive week of declining claims. While the trend is encouraging, the rate of losses means US unemployment is still on course to reach levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  The figures are also still undercounting the number of people out of work. Some states are still dealing with backlogs of claims after their systems were overwhelmed by the massive volume of applications.  Florida has become a notable black spot. As of Tuesday the state had received more than 1.9 million claims and processed just over 664,000, one of the slowest rates in the nation.

Im part of the team, Fauci told NBCs Today. The team is called Operation Warp Speed. Subtle. Background: the Trump administration is planning to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine with the goal of having 100 million doses ready by the end of 2020, a senior unnamed administration official said on Wednesday, Reuters reported. Executives and other experts have previously suggested that clinical trials to guarantee a vaccine is safe and effective could take a minimum of 12 to 18 months. Several agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services announced plans earlier in April to partner with more than 15 drug companies as well as European regulators in an effort to spur development of vaccines and treatments for the disease.The latest Trump administration efforts to speed vaccine development were originally reported by Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter. The project will join private pharmaceutical companies with government agencies and the military in trying to cut the development time for a vaccine by as much as eight months, Bloomberg News said, with some folks comparing it to the Manhattan Project that developed the nuclear bomb. Fauci said the best case scenario was a widely-available vaccine by January 2021.  We are in the early, phase one, of the trial, the next phase is to find out whether it works and is safe, he said. If it goes to plan, who will be there to welcome it? President Trump or President Biden.  Updated at 2.35pm BST    2.04pm BST   Donald Trump says China will do anything they can to prevent his reelection in November. The Guardians Alison Rourke and Lily Kuo have this report from an exclusive Reuters interview with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. The US president said he was looking at different options in terms of consequences for Beijing over the virus. I can do a lot, he said, without going into detail. Trump has increasingly blamed China for the pandemic and on Wednesday again said Beijing should have let the world know about the coronavirus much sooner. He also speculated about retaliation: There are many things I can do, he said. Were looking for what happened. For the first time, Trump linked Beijing to his re-election chances in November. China will do anything they can to have me lose this race, he said, adding that he believed China wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the race to ease the pressure on US-China trade relations. Theyre constantly using public relations to try to make it like theyre innocent parties, he said of Chinese officials. Trump said the trade deal that he concluded with Chinese president Xi Jinping aimed at reducing chronic US trade deficits with China had been upset very badly by the economic fallout from the virus.

Photograph: Apu Gomes/AFP via Getty Images   California governor Gavin Newsom will order all beaches and state parks closed again from tomorrow.  A memo by the California Police Chiefs Association outlining the decision said it was initatiated after the well-publicized media coverage of overcrowded beaches this past weekend. The governor was reportedly concerned after tens of thousands of people flocked to state shores last weekend during a heat wave, in violation of Californias mandatory stay-at-home order.  Newsom targeted beachgoers in Orange and Ventura counties as setting a poor example if the state wants to continue its progress fighting the coronavirus.Those images are an example of what not to see, what not to do if were going to make the meaningful progress weve made the past couple of weeks, Newsom told local station KABC. Local leaders shot back at criticism over keeping the beaches open.  Donald Wagner, member of the Orange County board of supervisors said on Wednesday that closing the beaches was the governors right, but added it is not wise to do so. Medical professionals tell us the importance of fresh air and sunlight in fighting infectious diseases, including mental health benefits, Wagner wrote. There is no scientific or medical evidence that sunlight or fresh air play any role in combating the coronavirus.     1.45pm BST  Fauci gives more cautious praise for virus treatment     White House coronavirus task force leaders Anthony Fauci (L) and Deborah Birx in the Oval Office yesterday. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP   Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the top public health official on the White House coronavirus task force, had more to say this morning about the preliminary results of the most promising trial yet of the drug remdesivir to treat Covid-19. A relatively large study conducted by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) showed some hopeful results for remdesivir, an experimental antiviral produced by the US pharmaceutical company Gilead, initially as a potential treatment for the Ebola virus. The main finding is that the drug reduced the amount of time that patients with severe coronavirus had to spend in hospital from 16 days (with a placebo) to 11 days. The clinical trial has not been peer-reviewed and these are strictly preliminary results. Its early days. But Fauci told ABCs Good Morning America today that the results were clearly positive if modest. Its a first step in what we project will be better and better drugs coming along, alone or in combination. So its good news but...this is not the total answer. It is expected to be approved as an emergency treatment by the US regulator the Food and Drug Administration relatively soon, Fauci said.

He initially cooperated with the investigation, which concluded last year without establishing criminal conspiracy but did lay out extensive evidence of contact between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president himself. Flynn hired a new lawyer, earlier this year, Fox News pundit Sidney Powell, a longtime critic of the Mueller inquiry who has peddled numerous false conspiracy theories on the investigation and other Trump policies and issues in prime time interviews. In March Trump tweeted: So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has lost the records of General Michael Flynn.

"2020-05-01T00:00:09Z","world","World news","Ms Du, door sensors and me: life with a Beijing Covid-19 quarantine handler","Every day for the last two weeks I have spoken with Ms Du, a mild-mannered, middle-aged woman who is my quarantine handler. She calls me in the morning to remind me to send her my temperature. She calls again if I forget to send the afternoon reading. She texts rose emojis, asking me to please cooperate with the rules. If I open my door, equipped with a sensor, to put the rubbish in the hall or pick up a delivery, she immediately calls and tells me to let her know beforehand. After returning from a reporting trip to Wuhan, I have been in strict self-isolation in my apartment in Beijing. Most days I get calls not just from Du but the local police station, perhaps checking the spelling of my name, someone from the health department asking about my travel history, or other representatives from the neighbourhood committee. They send messages reminding me to cover my mouth when coughing and not to spit wherever you please. The calls and questions, politely made, are constant and after a few days I already feel harried. A pink slip of paper with hearts taped to my door alerts my neighbours how long my quarantine should last.    A woman sits in a square in Beijing, where lockdown measures have been eased. Photograph: Roman Pilipey/EPA   In the last few weeks, I find that my friends and family elsewhere have started to look at China and its ability to enforce coronavirus measures with a mixture of awe and envy. Many also find it disconcerting. In addition to an army of local residents like Du, the tools of Chinas surveillance state help track residents who may pose a health risk. What strikes me, however, is how confused and sometimes absurd the enforcement of these measures can be. To the outside world, Chinas lockdowns and strict quarantine requirements are evidence of its vast state power and draconian tendencies. But on the ground, the implementation is often bureaucratic and bumbling and the measures more tedious and overbearing than intimidating.   Related: Chinese to hit the road again on first national holiday since lockdown   A week into my quarantine, I was told to start filling in a daily sheet on whether or not I have experienced a cough, sore throat, fatigue, runny nose, aches, diarrhoea or vomiting that day - ticking yes or no for each symptom. A day later, Du said I would also need to submit my temperature five times a day - every three hours from 9am to 9pm. I negotiated the check-ins down to the original twice a day. There are loopholes and inconsistencies. A friend in what is called centralised quarantine at a designated hotel, mainly for those who have come from overseas, has snuck out several times, wandering the halls and going to the buildings roof. Other apartment compounds have asked returning residents to simply promise not to go out. In some cases, the processes appear to be well-planned but little effort has been made to communicate to people what will happen. In March, my husband was put into centralised quarantine and delivered to a hotel with nothing more than a list of instructions in Chinese on how to report his temperature and when he could open his windows. There were no details about how he would get meals or water. For any questions, contact the work group, it said, without listing any contact information.    Students at Hubeis Wuchang high school receive coronavirus tests. Photograph: China News Service via Getty Images   Both residents and the people in charge of their quarantines are at the mercy of vague policies, announced with little warning. In one of our more personal exchanges, Du said my quarantine would be extended by seven extra days. She listened patiently while I had a minor meltdown, demanding to know how they could arbitrarily lock me at home for three weeks. I understand how you feel, and a lot of people feel the way you do, she said, promising she would take it up with her superiors. After 14 days of working from home, doing workout videos and cooking elaborate meals for myself, I finally got a chance to see Du. She was younger than I expected, dressed in a face mask, gloves and a red armband identifying herself as a community volunteer. She was with two medics in full hazmat suits who had come to test whether or not I have the virus. As I squatted down in front of my door so a medic could swab my throat, Du filmed the exchange on her mobile phone. Later that day, Beijing officials announced the city was downgrading its emergency response level. I sent Du and others several messages highlighting the part of the press conference that seemed to mean I was no longer subject to an extra week of quarantine. No one responded except to say they had not received any directive yet. The next morning, a man came to take the sensor off my door. As he tugged at the device and scraped at the adhesive, I asked whether or not I could leave. I dont know, he said. Youll have to ask someone else.","818"
