# First Year Project: COVID Impact on Media - Analysis of Public Health Discussion in The News Over Time (2021)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the extent of public health discussion in news media over time, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to understand how the pandemic has influenced media coverage globally and assess the frequency of public health topics in various news sections.

## Research Question

- **Primary Objective**: To determine the degree of public health discourse in the news as a result of the pandemic.
- **Secondary Objective**: To examine the overall impact of COVID-19 on news media, beyond just public health topics.

## Dataset Description

- **Source**: The Guardian Open API.
- **Data**: Includes headlines, sections, body text, and publication dates from the last two years, encompassing about 150,000 articles.
- **Pre-processing**: Data is processed to generate an influence score for each article using a custom algorithm, focusing on the relevance to COVID-19.

## Computational Overview

- **Data Extraction**: Implemented using Python, with functions to pull data from the API and process it into a structured format.
- **Custom Algorithm**: Used to calculate an influence score for each article, considering word relevance and count.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI created with Pygame, allowing users to view statistics and interactive graphs based on genre and time.

## Usage

1. **Data Retrieval**: Execute the provided scripts to pull raw data from The Guardian API.
2. **Running the Analysis**: Process the raw data using the provided algorithms to generate influence scores.
3. **Interactive Application**: Utilize the GUI to explore the impact of COVID-19 on different news genres over various time periods.

## Project Contributions

- **Data Analysis**: Insights on how media focus shifts in response to global health crises.
- **Technical Implementation**: Demonstrates effective use of Python for data scraping, processing, and visualization.

## Future Work

- **Algorithm Improvement**: Enhancing the accuracy and versatility of the custom algorithm.
- **Data Source Diversification**: Including more news sources to reduce bias and broaden the analysis scope.
- **Advanced Representations**: Expanding analysis to assess the type of influence (positive/negative), geographical impact, and broader categories.
